The duo — who <a href=#>tied the knot in April 2011</a> — also appeared on the Vampire Diaries together from 2012 to 2013 during DeVitto’s stint as Dr. Meredith Fell.</p><p>“I’m just a very lucky guy — very lucky. I don’t know why she went for me, but somehow a girl liked me for longer than a month,” Wesley told Us Weekly of DeVitto at Spike TV’s Scream Awards in October 2011.</p><p>Despite the Guiding Light alum’s sweet statements, the <a href=#>duo split in July 2013 after two years of marriage</a>. “They will continue to remain good friends,” reps for the two actors told Us at the time. That September, Us broke the news that <a href=#>Wesley had moved on</a> with Vampire Diaries costar <a href=#><strong>Phoebe Tonkin</strong></a>. The CW stars dated on and off for four years, calling it quits for good in October 2017.</p><p>During one of their “on” periods, Tonkin gushed about her beau to <a href=# rel=noopener>Elle Canada</a>. “He’s <a href=#>my best friend</a>. It’s such a fun time in my life right now,” the Australia native told the outlet in March 2015. “It’s nice to have someone to share all that with.”</p><p>Less than a year after <a href=#>his split from Tonkin</a>, Wesley sparked dating rumors with <a href=#><strong>Ines de Ramon</strong></a> in June 2018 when the two were spotted holding hands. The following February, the pair were seen wearing wedding bands. Another Vampire Diaries star — <a href=#><strong>Nina Dobrev</strong></a> — ultimately confirmed that the director and the model <a href=#>had secretly tied the knot</a>.</p><p>“We’re really good friends. I love his wife,” Dobrev said of the Star Trek: Strange New Worlds actor during a June 2019 appearance on the “Directionally Challenged” podcast.</p><p>Despite many <a href=#>relationship goals-worthy double dates </a>with Dobrev and <a href=#><strong>Shaun White</strong></a>, Wesley and de Ramon quietly separated in April 2022.</p><p>“The <a href=#>decision to separate is mutual and occurred 5 months ago</a>. They request privacy at this time,” a rep for the exes told Us that September.</p><p>The Late Bloomer actor and the jewelry designer both moved on with new flames shortly thereafter. In December 2022, Us confirmed that de Ramon and <a href=#><strong>Brad Pitt</strong></a> are an item.</p><p>“Brad and Ines are officially dating now. They really enjoy each other’s company and are <a href=#>having a great time in the early stages</a> of an early relationship, but are still getting to know each other,” a source said at the time.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Wesley, for his part, was <a href=#>seen packing on the PDA</a> with model <a href=#><strong>Natalie Kuckenburg</strong></a> in Nerano, Italy, in November 2022. One month later, the pair cozied up together at a New York Knicks game at Madison Square Garden.</p><p>Scroll through for a look back at Wesley’s dating history:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkvaLBy2aunqucmsa0ecOaq6Kml2K1qr%2FTqKmyZZ6WwaK4yJ5kpK2ToLKvrtSrnmaZnpl6rrvRnmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
