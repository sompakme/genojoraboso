There can be several reasons to get <a href=#>a fancy boat</a> - it can be a gift for a loved one or an expensive toy to cruise around in. It can also be a perfect party pad on water. Other times, it is simply a symbol of wealth and power, like in the case of <a href=#>royal families</a> who have not one but several boats and jets in their collection.</p><p>Seeing their rising demand in recent years, yachts today come packed with insane features, and here’s a list of celebrities who own some of the finest boats afloat.</p><h2 id=vajoliroja-amphitrite>Vajoliroja/ Amphitrite</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Johnny Depp</a> named one of his most fancy purchases Vajoliroja, after his then-lover Vanessa Paradis alongside their two children Lily-Rose and Jack. It is a massive superyacht with five cabins, a master stateroom, a luxurious cabin, a bunk cabin, a double cabin, and a twin cabin. In addition, the boat can accommodate up to 10 guests.</p><p>Johnny Depp <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sold the yacht for about $27 million</a> to the Harry Potter series JK Rowling author in 2016. Rowling renamed this yacht Amphitrite and later put it up for sale after cruising with her family.</p><h2 id=venus>Venus</h2><p>Philippe Starck's design company Ubik specially designed this superyacht for Steve Jobs, and it took a whopping $120 million to build it. <a href=#>The co-founder of Apple</a> had this yacht commissioned to be made before his death in 2011.</p><p>The yacht is 257 feet long, and its exterior is made of glass. One of its most attractive features is the seven 27-inch iMacs that this vessel has been fitted with. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">current owner of this vessel is Lauren Powell Jobs</a>, the wife of the late Steve Jobs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-seven-seas>The Seven Seas</h2><p>The famous director Steven Spielberg purchased the ‘Seven Seas’ for $184 million and put it <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">up for sale in 2015 for about $200 million</a>. As extravagant as it sounds, this vessel's grand features indeed seem worth that massive price.</p><p><a href=#>Spielberg is one of the highest-earning film directors</a> in the Hollywood industry, and this yacht is just the level of luxury that he can easily afford. The boat can accommodate 12 guests on board, with a total capacity of about 26 crew members. The private jacuzzi deck on this boat is among the several special attractions of the yacht.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Jordan $80 Million Joy Superyacht: Luxury On The Sea</a></span></p><h2 id=topaz>Topaz</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Topaz, launched in the year 2012, is a luxury motorboat whose exterior has been designed by Tim Heywood, and the interior has been done by Terence Disdale Design. The deputy prime minister of UAE owns it, Mansour bin Zayed bin Sultan bin Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan commonly referred to as Sheikh Mansour. He is also <a href=#>a member of the royal family</a> of Abu Dhabi.</p><p>This super boat has an astounding price of about $527 million and comes with a hoard of luxury amenities. The boat's interior has a large jacuzzi, a modern gymnasium, a cinema, and a conference room; plus, the boat is entirely air-conditioned for the Sheikh’s comfort.</p><h2 id=eclipse>Eclipse</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eclipse is the second largest and the second most expensive superyacht in the world, and it is <a href=#>owned by the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich</a>. It is also probably the most secure super vessel ever made, functioning on advanced technology to detect intruders and launch missiles for its safety.</p><p>That is not all; it also has bulletproof windows, mini-submarines, 25 cabins, swimming pools, and multiple dance halls. The owner is not a fan of sudden attacks from the paparazzi, which is why an anti-paparazzi system with laser beams has been constructed on the yacht. This massive vessel is about 533 feet long and boasts a price tag of approximately $1.5 billion.</p><h2 id=history-supreme>History Supreme</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The History Supreme is considered the largest yacht globally, owned by a celebrity business person and <a href=#>billionaire Robert Kuok</a>, who is reportedly the richest man in Malaysia. The grand purchase of this billion-dollar vessel by Kuok created enough hype amongst yacht owners and enthusiasts.</p><p>The History Supreme has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a jaw-dropping price tag of about $4.8 billion</a>. This is one of the priciest possessions of Kuok, who has a net worth of about $12.6 billion. It is rumoured that Kuok was not a very popular personality until he made the grand purchase. The Yacht is about 100 feet long and has a master suite which comes with the most exquisite thighs in the world - a meteorite rock wall, a statue made of Tyrannosaurus Rex bones, a 68 kg 24-carat gold Aquavista Panoramic Wall Aquarium, and a liquor bottle adorned with a rare 18.5-carat diamond.</p><p>Some of the other expensive celebrity boats in the world are ‘Azzam’, which is worth over $600 million and is owned by a member of the royal family of the UAE, and ‘Motor Yacht A’, worth over $440 million, is owned by <a href=#>Andrey Melnichenko</a>. Having a yacht commissioned and built is a symbol for the most powerful, and a hefty price tag is not usually their primary concern.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Luxury Cars Of Mr. Samuel L.
