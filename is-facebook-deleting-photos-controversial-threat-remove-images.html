Earlier this year, they were moved to Moments, a new app from Facebook. If you want to keep these photos, download and log into Moments before 7 July. If you don’t want Moments, download these photos directly to your computer from your Facebook profile before 7 July.”</strong></p><p>It’s worth noting that the removal of synced photos will not impact any photos or videos shared separately on Facebook.&nbsp;</p><p>Facebook has given its clients the chance to download their synchronized photographs before the cancellation happens.</p><p>Facebook’s latest move should come as no surprise, considering the company’s previous tactics with its Messenger app.</p><p>By separating the chat feature from the main Facebook app and compelling users to install Messenger, Facebook successfully amassed over 900 million users on the standalone platform.</p><p>Facebook’s decision to discontinue photo syncing on its main app and the subsequent threat of deleting synced photos is a strategic push towards the adoption of Moments.</p><p>The app has quickly gained momentum, soaring to the top of the charts for free Android and iOS apps.</p><p>It has captured a prominent position in the UK and steadily growing in popularity across the US.</p><p>Despite these significant developments, Facebook has chosen not to provide an official comment on the matter.</p><p>The new decision has left users to speculate about the motivations behind these decisions.</p><p>Users who wish to retain their synced photos should take proactive measures before the specified deadline.</p><p>By doing so, they can ensure the preservation of their valuable photo collections and avoid any potential loss.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC10madmpuVl7ywt4ydnKWdpJ67qHnPoaatp6NisLC606umr52iqLaiuIytn6udkal6s7HMqK2eZZmirqix0mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
