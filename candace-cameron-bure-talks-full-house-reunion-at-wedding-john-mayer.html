Bure, who played DJ Tanner on the beloved family sitcom, posted a snap—amongst many others—from the local parade with her onscreen bestie <strong>Andrea Barber</strong>. (Mayer, who owns a home in Paradise Valley, named his sixth studio album after the Montana locale.)</p><p>"He gave me a huge hug and remembered me," Bure gushed of 36-year-old Mayer, "so I was really excited."</p><p>Mayer's recollection of Bure was not only from her smash '90s TV show, but it turns out that Katy Perry's ex is familiar with the Full House fam. "He's actually great friends with <strong>Bob Saget</strong> and <strong><a href=#>John Stamos</a></strong>," Bure told <strong>Us</strong>. "So I've hung out with him… we've all hung out together."</p><p>The last time the troupe convened was in NYC earlier this year. "He's hung out a handful of times, but I felt like he remembered me all on his own," Bure cheerily recalled. "I was like, 'This is awesome! This is great!'" Joking, the DWTS alum added, "I was way more excited seeing John Mayer than my Full House family."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Bure and her former costars—Barber (Kimmy Gibler), Stamos (Uncle Jesse), Saget (Danny Tanner), and Full House show creator <strong>Jeff Franklin—</strong>reunited for 54-year-old Coulier's <a href=#>wedding to <strong>Melissa Bring</strong></a>. "It was fantastic," Bure gushed of getting back together with her famous TV family. "We're always together, so it's not a new thing for us," she shared, "but what a great reason to be together again!"</p><p>As for the rustic outdoor nuptials? "The highlight for me was watching Melissa, Dave's wife, walk down the—I would say the aisle, but it was the field. She was so incredibly beautiful! She's one of my best friends, so that was incredible to see her in and definitely a highlight."</p><p>Overall, Bure told <strong>Us</strong>, "we had a blast. We goofed off for three days, and the Full House family, I mean, they're family."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacmZ6ZrqSxjJyYpp2ipLturtSrnGaskaG4tHnFrqOlZZikwrSxjKucrqaZpLturdNmrp6clJ67qHnJqJ%2BnZZ2Wxqa%2BjGtnamxpbHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
