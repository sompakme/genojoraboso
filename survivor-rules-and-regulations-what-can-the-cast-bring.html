Since its debut in 2000, the game of <a href=#>Survivor</a> has changed in many ways. However, one thing has remained the same: There are strict rules that the castaways must follow.</p><p>Some rules are put in place for safety reasons. For example, the CBS cast must sign a lengthy contract ahead of time, which includes an agreement to be <a href=#>filmed at all hours of the day</a> and “have no expectations of privacy.” They also must all disclose their complete medical histories.</p><p>The rules continue after being voted off the island too. Those who don’t make the jury aren’t sent home. Instead, they’re required to stay with production in a different location — <a href=#>for free!</a> — until the season is done being filmed.</p><p>Of course, there are times when the rules get broken. In 2016, the cast of season 33, Millennials v Gen X, had to leave camp due to a cyclone. This marked the first time that the entire cast was evacuated and that the <a href=#>competitors were able to sleep inside</a> — but they still weren’t comfortable.</p><p>“We made the decision to bring them to base camp so that we would all be together. We put each tribe in a separate room with absolutely nothing in it. No food, no blankets, no pillows, nothing. They were monitored by producers the entire night,” host and executive producer <a href=#><strong>Jeff Probst</strong></a> told Entertainment Weekly at the time. “And, to their credit, they did not talk or try to form alliances. They honored the good <a href=#>faith agreement we had made</a>. The next morning, we returned them to the beaches and the game resumed.”</p><p>Although alliances are a big part of the game, don’t get too close! Agreeing to share any portion of the million-dollar prize is also not allowed and can result in punishment. Plus, contracts and NDAs play into the show even after filming wraps.</p><p>Everything must be kept secret before the season airs. Season 37’s <strong>Alec Merlino</strong> shared a photo of himself and contestant <strong>Kara Key</strong> before David vs. Goliath premiered in 2018 and wasn’t allowed to attend the reunion show — which also <a href=#>garners a $10,000 paycheck</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In fact, the contract they sign ahead of filming lasts a long time, meaning the cast is not allowed to share “the ways of production” until three years after their season airs on TV.</p><p>Scroll down for more Survivor rules:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BowrPCyK%2Bmq2Wiqrmmv4yapZ1lopq0trjAraCopqNixKmt02aamqZdqbWmecKaqq1lkqe2r7OO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
