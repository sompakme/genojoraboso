One got so out of hand that Zendaya herself had to address it. After a TikTok stating the star was pregnant with her boyfriend's baby went viral, <a href=#>Zendaya took to Instagram to set the record straight</a>. "See now, this is why I stay off Twitter. Just making stuff up for no reason … weekly," said the star in her Instagram stories in June 2022. The couple is incredibly private, <a href=#>only making their relationship known to the public after they were caught making out by paparazzi in 2021</a>. Chances are, if they ever do have children together, we will be the last to know about it.</p><h2 id=kourtney-kardashian-barker-has-faced-numerous-pregnancy-rumors><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Kourtney Kardashian Barker Has Faced Numerous Pregnancy Rumors</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/kourtney-kardashian-at-the-premiere-of-her-springsummer-2023-boohoo-x-kourtney-kardashian-barker-line.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Anytime Kourtney Kardashian Barker posts a picture with the slightest sign of a "belly" fans go wild in her comments section, speculating the reality star is pregnant. Rather than sitting ideally by, she decided to stop any speculation by responding to comments on a 2021 Instagram post. In response to a user who commented, "SHE'S PREGNANT," Kourtney said, "I'm a woman with a body."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Are Kourtney Kardashian And Travis Barker Getting Their Own Reality Show?</a></span></p><p>In 2020, she responded to another troll in the comments speculating she was pregnant, saying, "This is me when I have a few extra pounds on, and I actually love it.

So much so that it's stirred up several crazy pregnancy rumors around the star. In 2020, she all but begged the media to stop publishing false rumors about her, saying, "I'm not pregnant. Please stop writing false stories from your 'sources' and focus on what's important."</p><p>Following her and Justin's appearance at the 2022 Grammy Awards, there was another slew of rumors about Hailey being pregnant. Many fans on Twitter and Instagram were sure they saw a bump under the model's flowy pearl-colored dress. Hailey quickly pointed out how wrong the public was in their assumptions, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sharing that she actually had an apple-sized cyst on her ovary</a>.</p><h2 id=selena-gomez-has-faced-multiple-false-pregnancy-rumors><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Selena Gomez Has Faced Multiple False Pregnancy Rumors</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/selena-gomez-at-a-nyc-showing-of-her-documentary.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Selena Gomez has dealt with numerous pregnancy rumors over the years. One went as far as saying she miscarried her and Justin Bieber's baby in 2012. While she never addressed that rumor directly, the star has gotten candid with fans about her health issues, recently sharing <a href=#>the very real and scary truth that she may not be able to have children on her own</a>. Something tells us that even with Selena being blatantly honest about her potential fertility issues, the trolls won't stop assuming her carrying some extra weight means she's pregnant, but who knows?</p><h2 id=issa-rae-wants-fans-to-know-she-is-not-pregnant><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Issa Rae Wants Fans To Know She Is Not Pregnant</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/issa-rae-attends-the-ebony-power100-gala-october-29-2022.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Issa Rae is not afraid to set the record straight on any crazy information floating around about herself. In March 2022, she did just that, as there were some pretty incessant rumors that the Insecure creator and star was pregnant. She took to Twitter to tell the public, "I am not pregnant, f--kyouverymuch." She followed up the explicit thank you message with, "LET A B---H EAT DRINK AND BE MERRY." After all the hard work she put into creating the final season of Insecure, it's really not that much to ask of people.​​​​​​​</p><h2 id=paris-hilton-has-faced-numerous-pregnancy-rumors-throughout-her-career><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Paris Hilton Has Faced Numerous Pregnancy Rumors Throughout Her Career</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/paris-hilton-attending-the-lacma-art-film-gala-2022-at-the-los-angeles-county-museum-of-art.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Paris Hilton has been hit with a barrage of wacky pregnancy rumors over the years. In 2021, the heiress awoke to a Page Six article going viral <a href=#>that stated the reality tv star was pregnant with her first child</a>. She immediately took to her podcast <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">to clear the air with her fans</a>. "It's incredible that I can just talk to you guys and tell you all what's happening right away, instead of the media always controlling the narrative and controlling my story, as they have for many, many years," she said on her This Is Paris podcast.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is Paris Hilton's Baby Voice Real?</a></span></p><p>The rumors were getting so out of control last year that Paris even took time to tell people when they could expect to see her as a mother. In late 2022, Paris shared on Instagram that she and her husband Carter were taking in their first year as a married couple, just the two of them. They planned on adding to their family in 2023, and they did just that, welcoming a baby boy via surrogate in January 2023.​​​​​​​</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-garner-wants-fans-to-know-she-39-s-done-with-being-pregnant><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Jennifer Garner Wants Fans To Know She's Done With Being Pregnant</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/jennifer-garner-attending-the-2022-jhpiego-awards-ceremony.jpg><p>In true Jennifer Garner fashion, the actress responded to an Instagram comment asking if she was pregnant in the sweetest, most direct way possible. "I am 48, have 3 healthy kids, and am not—and never will be—pregnant. We can lay that pupper to rest. Have I gained the Covid 19? Possibly. But that is another story," wrote the actress in response to the comment. The Instagram account "Comments By Celebs" posted a screenshot of the interaction with the caption, "Stop asking women if they're pregnant 2020." Agreed.​​​​​​​</p><h2 id=lili-reinhart-was-never-pregnant-with-cole-sprouse-39-s-baby><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Lili Reinhart Was Never Pregnant With Cole Sprouse's Baby</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/lili-reinhart-attends-the-2022-women-in-film-honors-held-in-los-angeles.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Riverdale actress puts up with a lot of unwarranted comments about her body, but she felt the need to respond to the 2018 rumor that she was pregnant with her then-boyfriend Cole Sprouse's baby. "It's unfortunate that one unflattering photo of my stomach circulating the internet causes hundreds of people to think that I'm pregnant. Nope. Not pregnant," she wrote via Instagram.</p><p>She spoke further with Entertainment Tonight about why she felt the need to respond to the rumor. "I feel like a lot of people say you should just sweep it under the rug, don't pay attention to it, but that's never really been my style. Maybe some people find that obnoxious, but I felt the need to say, 'No. I'm not pregnant," she said to ET.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGixnqaUlsaieceaoKWdqWKvqrHBnqlmm5WhsqO%2B0aKrsmWgp7KousCnmrJloqq6sL7SaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
