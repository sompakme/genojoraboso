Soap operas including Days of Our Lives, The Young and the Restless and One Life to Live have<a href=#> inspired love stories both on and off the screen.</a></p><p><a href=#><strong>Kelly Ripa</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Mark Consuelos</strong></a> started dating shortly after <a href=#>playing love interests on All My Children</a> in 1995.</p><p>“I auditioned him. They’d been looking for this character for some time … They didn’t want a dark-haired guy, they wanted a Latino actor. So I had auditioned every Latino actor in the city and around the city and then California,” Ripa detailed during a SiriusXM interview in August 2018. “Then all of a sudden, Judy Blye Wilson, who was the casting director in All My Children, said, ‘I found him’ … [Judy] showed me his picture and … when I saw him, the photograph of him, I saw my entire future with him flash before [my eyes]. Like, I saw it. I [didn’t] believe in any of that and now I do because of that moment.”</p><p>Following one year of dating, the couple <a href=#>eloped in Las Vegas and later expanded their family</a> with kids Michael, Joaquin and Lola. Ripa and Consuelos <a href=#>reunited on screen several times over the years</a> with projects such as Hope & Faith and Riverdale.</p><p>“[Riverdale creator] <strong>Roberto [Aguirre-Sacasa]</strong> called me and said, ‘Hey, I’ve got a question to ask you. Do you think she’d want to do it?’ And I said, ‘You know, yeah. Give her a call!’ They spoke and they figured it out,” the Spain native, <a href=#>who played Hiram Lodge on the hit CW series</a>, exclusively told Us Weekly in 2019. “Roberto’s awesome, man. No one knows this world better than him. He just made it happen. I definitely did not ask for him to do that. I think he thought it would be so much fun.”</p><p>In February 2023, Ripa announced that Consuelos<a href=#> would be her new cohost on Live</a> after <a href=#><strong>Ryan Seacrest</strong></a>‘s departure.</p><p>“We figured that since we started our careers together, we might as well finish them together,” the duo told Us <a href=#>about the decision to work together</a> again. “We figured the idea ‘what could possibly go wrong?’ is something we’d definitely like to explore. Now, we have the chance.”</p><p>Meanwhile, <strong>Susan Walters</strong> and <a href=#><strong>Linden Ashby</strong></a> exchanged vows three months after <a href=#>meeting on ABC’s&nbsp;Loving&nbsp;in 1986.</a> Walters, who has starred in several projects with her husband over the years, <a href=#>gushed about their connection after three decades of marriage.</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“37 years (and a day) of dogs and daughters, horses and houses, friends and family, ups and downs… and love. ❤️❤️❤️,” the actress captioned an Instagram post in April 2023. “Happy Anniversary to the one I’m so lucky to be living my life with.”</p><p>Scroll down for more couples who met on a soap opera set:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BYsq2xwaugrbFdmLy2vMueqmavmKR6rrHTZqanZaOkrrF5zqmcq5mjYq6tuIymsGabmJ65pb7Ep2Smp6KafA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
