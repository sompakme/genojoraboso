Sexy Beasts puts each contestant into heavy makeup and prosthetics to ensure their physical features are disguised, making this a truly unique dating show that is actually based solely on personality. Here's what we know about this creative new show so far...</p><h2 id=it-s-weird-enough-to-work><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>It's Weird Enough To Work</span></h2><p>CNN reveals that each episode is centralized around a single person who<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> wants to meet someone and fall in love</a>, based solely on an emotional connection. Finding someone with a great personality is usually a process that is clouded over by appearances and the assessment of aesthetic image, but Sexy Beasts stands to change that perspective entirely.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Potential love matches are costumed with makeup and prosthetics to create the ultimate disguise. Each single contestant gets to see the real face of their 'match', only after they've selected them!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflixâ€™s Reality Show 'Sexy Beasts' Takes Blind Dates To A Whole New Level</a></span></p><h2 id=the-show-aims-to-get-rid-of-superficial-dating><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>The Show Aims To Get Rid Of Superficial Dating</span></h2><p>Sexy Beasts is being hailed as a true opportunity for real people to get past the superficial elements of the dating game. It can be incredibly frustrating for singles to get to know someone's personality only after their physical selves have been presented as a perfect match. To alleviate the pressure of looks and superficiality, Netflix ensures full disguises completely conceal each person's identity, and contestants are forced to rely on personality traits, alone. The conventional comforts of appearances are completely eliminated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=there-s-a-whole-lot-of-elaborate-makeup-and-prosthetics><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>There's A Whole Lot Of Elaborate Makeup And Prosthetics</span></h2><p>One thing you can count on for sure is the presence of a whole lot of makeup and prosthetics. Makeup artists and designers are hard at work for this show, creating unique animal characters and physical disguises that are unique, bizarre, and completely wild. The contestants will not have any opportunity to see past these intricate cover-ups and will have no choice but to rely on meaningful connections to get past this series.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything We Know About ABC's New Dating Show, 'The Celebrity Dating Game'</a></span></p><h2 id=two-seasons-are-already-guaranteed><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Two Seasons Are Already Guaranteed</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It may take some viewers a bit of time to warm up to this series, and that's ok. In spite of the fact that we haven't even seen a single episode of this show yet, it has already been revealed that Netflix has automatically signed up for two full seasons of Sexy Beasts.&nbsp;Producers have high hopes for the success of the show and are convinced that the unique elements of their programming will attract significant viewership.</p><h2 id=fans-are-already-buzzing-with-excitement><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Fans Are Already Buzzing With Excitement</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's safe to say that Sexy Beasts is already <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">drawing quite a bit of attention</a>. Fans have already responded well to the more conventional dating shows that have been presented, and by all accounts, this one sounds far more intriguing and more likely to be too good to pass up. Even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans that are baffled by what they see </a>within the trailer are intrigued enough to tune in, just to see how this bizarre plot line plays out.

Sexy Beasts is based on a British series that was created for BBC Three, and when that was first released, it was an instant hit in the UK. The shock value that was offered through the show was a huge hit and it is expected to be the same when presented to a North American audience. It's been tried, tested, and proven to be a huge success already!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=zn-body__paragraph><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Of The Strangest Reality Dating Shows From The 2000s</a></span></p><h2 id=launch-date-and-episode-details-have-been-released><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Launch Date And Episode Details Have Been Released</span></h2><p>There are some juicy details available for fans that need to know the specifics.
