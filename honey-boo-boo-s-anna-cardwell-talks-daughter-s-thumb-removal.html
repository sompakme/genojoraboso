You don’t know that.’ She was like, ‘Well then, Ma, you can get on to them and go back and pick at them.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/anna-cardwell-2-738a1470-aeb4-4384-9b0a-695d237041c2.jpg><p>Kaitlyn then had a change of heart and grew excited for her surgery. Now she adorably believes that her thumb was magically removed and that she has <i>Frozen</i> superpowers as a result. “We kept telling her that it was magic, that the doctor would do magic … they would put her to sleep, and then that it was going to be magically gone, and she got all excited about it,” Anna explained. “And now she thinks somehow, now that it’s healing [at] home, she thinks she’s gonna have <i>Frozen</i> powers.”</p><p>Anna, who is also mom of 11-month-old daughter Kylee with husband <b>Michael Cardwell</b>, told <i>Us</i> that not everyone in her family was on board for Kaitlyn to get her finger surgically removed.</p><p>“All my mama was worried about was would [Kaitlyn] have mobility in her thumb after the surgery,” the TLC alum explained. “That’s why she didn’t want [Kaitlyn] to get it done, and same for my sisters. … They got upset whenever I told them. I said, ‘I really hope Kylee don’t have it because I don’t want to go through it again.’ My sister Jessica got kind of really upset about that. And then [Kylee] ended up not having it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/anna-cardwell-3-faa02631-9065-454b-ab19-8abe2fd7503c.jpg><p>Kaitlyn’s abnormality was often discussed on <i>Here Comes Honey Boo Boo,</i> which was canceled in October 2014.
