That was dumb.”</p><span class=caption></span><p>Thornton and Dern shared a dog and lived together when they dated from 1997 to 1999. The <i>Bad Santa </i>actor called off their engagement and went on to marry Jolie, 41, just months later. Thornton and the <i>Maleficent</i> actress — they infamously wore vials of each other’s blood around their necks — would divorce in 2003 after three years of marriage.</p><p>Dern opened up about her messy split from Thornton during a past interview with <i>Talk </i>magazine. “I left our home to work on a movie, and while I was away, my boyfriend got married, and I’ve never heard from him again,” she said, via <a href=#><i>ABC News</i></a>. “It’s like a sudden death. For no one has there been any closure or clarity.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/billy-bob-thornton-laura-dern-2000-fd22b668-c500-488e-9623-a4ebc070a77b.jpg><p>Back in October, <a href=#><b>Melissa Etheridge</b> commented on Thornton</a> and Jolie’s relationship while discussing the actress’ current messy <a href=#>split from <b>Brad Pitt</b>.&nbsp;</a></p><p>“I was around when Angelina was not doing nice things with Billy Bob to Laura Dern. I went through that on a personal level, and then to know the side of <a href=#><b>Jennifer </b>[<b>Aniston</b>]<b> </b>and Brad,”</a> the singer, 55, said during <i>Watch What Happens Live</i>. “I helped Laura move out of her house with Billy Bob — I, like, broke into their home to get their stuff out because it was so nasty.”</p><p><i>Read more Globes reactions below:</i></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Laura Dern’s face when Billy Bob Thornton walked past her.
