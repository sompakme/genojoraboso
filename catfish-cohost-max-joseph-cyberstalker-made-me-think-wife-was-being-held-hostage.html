It was a hoax, of course.”</p><p>On <i>Catfish</i>, Joseph and his cohost,<b> Nev Schulman</b>, help a romantic hopeful learn more about his or her online significant other; oftentimes, their object of affection turns out to be someone different from how they represented themselves on the Internet.&nbsp;</p><p>The 34-year-old added that being a minor celebrity has also caused him to question whether he should be doing things such as tipping more or tweeting inspirational messages.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“And when tragedy strikes and the world takes to social media, is it now my responsibility to respond with #RIPs and #prayfors?” he continued. “I am stifled by the possibilities — too shy and self-conscious to leverage this power for world betterment or even personal gain.”</p><p>Joseph added that Schulman&nbsp;is “much better suited for celebrity” because he’s able to own the sense of entitlement that comes with being a public figure.</p><p>The reality personality hilariously recounted how he once approached <i>Gossip Girl</i>‘s&nbsp;<b><a href=#>Ed Westwick</a></b> to take a photo with his wife, and how the exchange left him feeling nervous and uncomfortable.</p><p>“I was so nervous and bumbling that I didn’t even see his outstretched hand that he was offering me,” he wrote. “He then proceeded to flirt with my wife before letting me snap a few pictures of them. The whole thing was very emasculating and made worse by the fact that he didn’t even know who I was. At least my wife walked away happy.”</p><p>The fifth season of <i>Catfish</i> premieres on MTV on Wednesday, February 24, at 10 p.m. EST.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacmaSbtrS0jJymoaejqXqurddmoairlaW1bq%2FYm5yrq6SWuayx0WakmpyVYrqmedOhoKejXay2p7GMsJisZZKatq%2BzjKGcpZxdnby0wMCgnGavYWuCc4KYaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
