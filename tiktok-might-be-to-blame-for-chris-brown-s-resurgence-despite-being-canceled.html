Under The Influence was on Chris Brown's 2019 album titled Indigo (Extended). It received the standard TikTok treatment of speeding up after which it promptly went viral.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Debuting on Billboard Top 100 last summer, the song climbed the ranks of popularity and finally has been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).</p><p>TikTok has single-handedly made Under The Influence the most streamed song in Brown's discography. Along with this, his songs No guidance and Go Crazy have also been viral on TikTok.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Is Chris Brown's Clothing Line Actually Worth And Why Hasn't It Been Canceled?</a></span></p><p>TikTok's influence can also be seen in how the "Under The Influence" music video was received; it was released three years after the song was released.</p><p>Within the span of a few months, it garnered over 90 million views. Even his clothing line, Black Pyramid, seems to have profited from his success on TikTok. He has even announced the "Under The Influence" Tour.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chris-also-released-new-music-to-critical-acclaim>Chris Also Released New Music (To Critical Acclaim)</h2><p><a href=#>Chris Brown has been quite busy after his revival on TikTok</a>.

He expressed disappointment with people who still hate him for "a mistake he made as a 17-year-old." He also said that white artists do not receive the same amount of backlash as he, a black man, does.</p><p>Netizens did not take well to his statement on Instagram. Many claimed he was "being manipulative" and was "changing the narrative" by claiming he was 17 instead of 19. Others joked that he might have misremembered his age because Rihanna might not have been his first victim.</p><p>Users also said he was misrepresenting facts as <a href=#>he has had abuse allegations even recently up to 2022</a> and that the Rihanna incident was not an isolated one.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Does Chris Brown's Mom Think Of His Criminal Past?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rihanna's bruised-up pictures from the assault also resurfaced online with a lot of people siding against Brown.
