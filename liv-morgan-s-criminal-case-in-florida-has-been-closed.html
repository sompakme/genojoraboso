Morgan was previously arrested for possession of marijuana (not more than 20 grams), possession of drug equipment, and possession of other drugs in December 2023. The arrest came after the sheriff’s deputy saw Morgan’s vehicle cross over the white and yellow lines of a county road. The charge for possession of drugs, possibly synthetic cannabinoids, was dropped later in December, as the State of Florida could not prove its case."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Johnson writes that Morgan was set for a hearing about the marijuana charge on February 20, but her attorney entered a plea of Nolo-Contendere on January 31. With this plea, the defendant does not officially admit guilt. Thaythey accept conviction as if a guilty plea had been entered against them.</p><p>Additionally, Johnson writes that Morgan was fined. Specifically, court records indicate that it was for $543. Johnson notes that the charge of possession of marijuana (not more than 20 grams) is a first-degree misdemeanor in Florida. The court records only list the fine. However, the offense can be punishable with up to a year in jail or on probation, along with a suspended driving license, random drug testing, and reimbursement of related fees.</p><p>As <a href=#>previously reported</a>, Liv Morgan did not have any heat from WWE management following the arrest.
