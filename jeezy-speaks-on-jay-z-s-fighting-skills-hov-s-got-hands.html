We was back to back. I hear his assistant say, ‘Jay, get in the car!’ and he was like, ‘I ain’t leaving Jeezy!’ I was like, I rock with him.”</p><p>Infamous for his street affiliations and credibility, Jeezy also pointed to their respective paths to success as the foundation upon which the pair found common ground.</p><p>“Me and Hov, mentally, we was connected because even if we wasn’t doing music we would rock with each other in a sense because we both had old souls and we both came from the same struggle,” explained Jeezy. “But the only thing is, his struggle started before mine and he started walking his path before me. So, I have to look at somebody like that how I would look at somebody in the hood who was already getting money before I was.”</p><p>Check out the snippet of Jeezy’s Uncensored episode below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5%2BypsbYZqGasV2veqe1xqGroqaXYsCstculqmagn6vAbrPOrWShmZ6ZwG59kWxrb2tkZX13ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
