While It’s known <a href=#>what the slain cast members have been up to since their departure from the show</a>, let’s take a look at what the stars that survived the finale have been up to since, shall we? Strap on your armor, sheath your broadsword and hop aboard a fire-breathing dragon; it's time to do this thing.</p><h2 id=kristofer-hivju><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Kristofer Hivju</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kristofer Hivju portrayed wilding leader, Brienne of Tarth-obsessed, Tormund Giantsbane on GoT. The character was not only a fan-favorite, but played for some of the greatest laughs whenever on screen. After the end of the series, Hivju would go on to voice the character of Jormungandr on the animated Disney series Duck Tales, and most recently debuted on The Witcher as Nivellen. The Norwgian actor is also set to be featured in the upcoming 2023 film Cocaine Bear and the science fiction comedy Distant.</p><h2 id=jacob-anderson><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Jacob Anderson</span></h2><p>Jacob Anderson has kept busy after portraying the loyal Grey Worm on GoT. Anderson has been featured in both big screen and small screen projects, such as appearing on SNL and starring as Vinder on Doctor Who. Most recently, has taken up the role of Louis in the AMC series Interview With A Vampire. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Unfortunately, many fans are pitting Anderson’s Louis against Brad Pitt's interpretation.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Game Of Thrones Made Emily Carey 'Nervous' About Doing These House Of The Dragon Scenes</a></span></p><h2 id=gwendoline-christie><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Gwendoline Christie</span></h2><p>Brienne of Tarth herself, Gwendoline Christie, decided to make a move back to the theatrical stage after GoT.

After the finale, Flynn showed up in films such as John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum. Flynn is also set to be featured in the upcoming Western miniseries 1923. Flynn’s career was quite extensive before he starred in GoT, and It seems like the Tommy Zoom actor is continuing that trend.</p><h2 id=isaac-hempstead-wright><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Isaac Hempstead Wright</span></h2><p>Who would have ever guessed that Bran would end up King of the North? Well, he did, and the less said about that the better. Anyhow, the actor that portrayed Bran, Isaac Hempstead Wright, hasn’t been extremely busy after the conclusion of GoT as far as acting roles goes. Wright’s only feature film was after Thrones was 2021’s Voyagers. It appears that the former King of the North is taking a break from acting for the moment. However, Wright did go back to school to study neuroscience at University College London.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=maisie-williams><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Maisie Williams</span></h2><p>There’s something about being a member of the GoT cast and starring in a Marvel property.

The former Jon Snow (he knows nothing, by the way) has traded in his broadsword for the Ebony Blade to play Dane Whitman aka Black Knight. Arlington made his debut as the character in The Eternals in 2021 and is set to return based on The Eternals post-credit scene. Hamilton also hosted SNL back in 2019 and starred in the sequel to How to Train Your Dragon, reprising his role as Eret.</p><h2 id=peter-dinklage><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Peter Dinklage</span></h2><p>Peter Dinklage was arguably the biggest star to emerge from the series. Portraying Tyrion Lannister, the hedonistic, family shame, quickly became one of the most popular characters of the show. After GoT finished up, Dinklage went on to be featured in such films as Avengers: Infinity War as Eitri The King of the Dwarves. Dinklage would also star as Cyrano in the off-Broadway play and in the 2021 film Cyrano de Bergerac.The X-Men: Days of Future’s Past star has recently had fans <a href=#>reject his criticism of Disney’s Snow White remake</a>.
