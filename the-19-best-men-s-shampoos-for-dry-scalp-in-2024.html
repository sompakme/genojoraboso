Flakes, dander, redness, irritation, and itchiness. We’re sure you know all these symptoms well. However, that doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice your peace of mind and quality of life. There are plenty of options available for treating dry scalp—some available at the drugstore and others you can make yourself at home.</p><h2><strong>What Is the Scalp? What Does It Do?</strong></h2><p>According to the INKEY List, “The scalp is tightly bound to the <i>galea aponeurotica</i>, the aponeurosis that directly covers the skull. It is made up of layers: a superficial epidermis and a deeper dermis layer, where the hair bulbs are densely packed. Within these layers, capillaries bring nourishment to the follicles from the blood. In turn, this secretes sebum, which ensures the protection and moisturization of the hair and scalp itself.”</p><p>Sounds complicated, right? The scalp maintains a diverse microbiome, filled with microorganisms—like bacteria and yeast—that protect the skin from irritants. On its own, the scalp should be well-balanced, but it can get thrown off—resulting in dryness, flakes, dandruff, and redness.</p><h2><strong>Scalp Disruptions</strong></h2><p>If you’re reading this article, you probably have dry scalp. But that’s not the only type of disruption the scalp can encounter. Here are a few types of scalp conditions and their symptoms.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><h3><strong>Dryness</strong></h3><ul><li aria-level=1>Little moisture: Your scalp needs hydration to function and thrive, so if you’re the kind of person to wash your hair frequently, you may be harming your scalp. Every time you wash your hair, you strip it of protective moisture and oils. This can result in overly-dry scalps. This can also happen if you live in a cold, dry climate.</li><li aria-level=1>Contact dermatitis: Have you ever used a hair care product that worsened your scalp? That’s called contact dermatitis. Sometimes, your scalp and hair just don’t mix well with certain ingredients found in hair care products.</li><li aria-level=1>Naturally occurring buildup: Oil, dead skin cells, sebum, sweat, dirt, bacteria, fungus, and loads of other irritants can find their way into your scalp, creating a recipe for disaster.</li><li aria-level=1>Product buildup: If you’re using the wrong product or using too much of it, residue can build up and cause dryness, flakes, and irritation.</li><li aria-level=1>Fungal infections: We briefly touched on this before, but fungal infections—like malassezia—can create intense dryness, leading to dandruff and itchiness.</li></ul><h3><strong>Dandruff</strong></h3><ul><li aria-level=1>Fungus: It’s gross to think about, but fungus is commonly caused by an overgrowth of malassezia, a yeast fungus that is mostly found on scalps. Some people are naturally born with it, others develop it through lifestyle choices.</li><li aria-level=1>Weather: The weather can affect your scalp and cause dandruff. Some people only experience dandruff seasonally, similar to seasonal allergies. Certain climates—like cool, dry, and higher elevations—tend to contribute to dandruff more than humid, wet environments.</li></ul><h2><strong>How to Prevent Scalp Issues&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Now that you know what causes dryness, irritation, and dandruff, you’re probably wondering if there is anything you can do to prevent these concerns from developing in the first place. The good news is you can do a lot to help ease your symptoms. Here are some of the best ways.</p><ul><li aria-level=1>Use products that are meant for your condition: There are a ton of shampoos, conditioners, sprays, and gels on the market. But that doesn’t mean they will all work for your hair. You want to use products—like the shampoos on this list—to treat your dry scalp.</li><li aria-level=1>Don’t overwash your hair: Resist the temptation to wash your hair daily because that can dry out your hair even more. We know it probably makes sense to wash your hair often because shampoos can hydrate, but you risk stripping away vital moisture that eases dryness. You can also consider using a co-wash on certain days, rather than a full-fledged shampoo. Co-washes retain moisture better, leaving hydration behind.</li><li aria-level=1>Avoid ingredients that irritate your scalp: This one can be hard to find out, but if you take the time to narrow down your list, it makes a world of difference. Typical ingredients—like sulfates, parabens, and alcohol—are known to dry out the hair and scalp. These are best avoided.</li><li aria-level=1>Use a nourishing conditioner: Conditioners are like lotion for your hair. They lock in moisture and protect the hair and scalp from irritants—like free radicals, UV rays, and blue light. Finding a conditioner that works well with your hair and brings life back into dull, dry locks is key.</li><li aria-level=1>Use a scalp exfoliator: Whether it’s a chemical peel or a massage-type device, getting circulation to your scalp can help ease dryness. The more blood flow there is to your head, the healthier it is.</li><li aria-level=1>Stop scratching: Yes, we know it feels good and it’s impossible to stop. But scratching only irritates your scalp more. You also risk introducing new bacteria and germs to your scalp by using unwashed hands to scratch your head.</li><li aria-level=1>Be adaptable: As the seasons change, your haircare routine needs to change too. Be prepared to find and use new products to suit your current needs.</li><li aria-level=1>Use hair masks: So many great hair masks on the market are perfect for dry scalps. Look for masks that use aloe vera, manuka honey, tea tree oil, and coconut oil. These ingredients are ultra-hydrating and will help bring moisture back into your scalp. Use a mask a few times weekly to see how your skin adapts.</li><li aria-level=1>Let your skin breathe: If you wear hats often, give yourself a break. Your skin, including your scalp, needs to breathe. When your scalp is covered by thick fabric, you risk smothering it. This, in turn, prevents your hair from healing as it should.</li><li aria-level=1>See a professional: At the end of the day, these tips and tricks may not work for you.
