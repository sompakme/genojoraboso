The pair dated from 1999 to 2002, before a messy break-up.</p><p>Justin seemed to imply that Britney cheated on him when he cast a look-a-like in his music video for “Cry Me A River,” released shortly after their break-up. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin later went on to apologize in 2021</a> or how he treated Britney post-split.</p><p>In the same post, he also apologized to Janet Jackson for failing to support her after she had a wardrobe malfunction during their joint Super Bowl performance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Creepy' Third Eye Blind Frontman Has A Framed Graphic Photo Of Britney Spears Taken Without Her Consent</a></span></p><p>"I specifically want to apologise to Britney Spears and Janet Jackson both individually, because I care for and respect these women and I know I failed,” he wrote. “I also feel compelled to respond, in part, because everyone involved deserves better and most importantly, because this is a larger conversation that I wholeheartedly want to be part of and grow from.”</p><p>"The industry is flawed. It sets men, especially white men, up for success,” Justin continued. “It's designed this way.

Not only is she expected to discuss her conservatorship and family, but fans are hoping she’ll discuss her infamous relationship with Justin Timberlake.</p><p>According to a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recent report by Daily Mail</a>, attorneys for Justin as well as one of Britney’s other exes, Collin Farrell, have filed a motion to delay the memoir’s publication for at least four months. Apparently, both actors want certain sections of the book omitted.</p><p>“Lawyers demanded to see her book in advance and were adamant that some of the revelations were removed,” a source claimed. “'There are still plenty of gobsmacking tales but Justin and Colin were conscious about what could be said about them.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, another source told the publication that there have been “no legal threats from Justin or Colin.” Britney herself has not confirmed or denied the speculation.</p><p>The singer has been vocal about how she hopes she can share her personal experiences to help others in similar positions. "I'm here to be an advocate for people with real disabilities and real illnesses," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she previously said</a>. "Hopefully, my story will make an impact and make some changes in the corrupt system."</p><p>Britney’s memoir is still expected to be released sometime this year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZq6Gko7K6edKpnJqqo2K%2FprLEq5ynm5WoeqbEjJumsp6inrKvsIyjrKysmaN6tbXMm5yrpJGgsm61zWaYZpqZr66zvsRmpZ6vXZ67tMDAoKmapV2lvLTAjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
