It was all run like a military operation to keep details under wraps, and Justin nailed it,” the source said.</p><p>This isn’t Bieber’s only cameo. The “Holy” singer previously made a cameo in Zoolander, where he portrayed himself in the 2016 hit movie. In 2014, Bieber also appeared in Behaving Badly, which starred his ex-girlfriend, Selena Gomez.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The “As I Am” singer also appeared in Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping alongside other musicians like Akon, DJ Khaled, and more.</p><p>Other than his appearances in movies, Bieber has also made cameos in music videos. He recently appeared in the music video for “Popstar” alongside his wife, Hailey Baldwin.</p><p>It is unclear how much Bieber makes for his cameos, but they are certainly a part of the <a href=#>singer’s massive net worth</a>. However, a huge chunk of his salary comes from his music.</p><p>Still, <a href=#>Looper </a>revealed that Brad Pitt received $1,000 for appearing in Deadpool 2.

A week later, Bieber sang for Usher, who happens to be Braun’s partner at Raymond Braun Media Group (RBMG).</p><p>Three years later, Bieber dropped his two-part album, My World and My World 2.0, which were a massive success. His third album, Believe also sold 3 million copies across the globe.</p><p>Despite his success, things haven’t always been easy for Bieber. In the documentary Seasons, <a href=#>Bieber revealed his struggles with drugs and alcohol</a>.</p><p>Today, Bieber seems to be in a much better place in his life. He dropped new songs, and he has also been spending a lot of time with his wife in their <a href=#>$26 million mansion in Beverly Hills</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>Justin Bieber's Million-Dollar Homes</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>The Sun</a>, <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS3tr%2FToqVmmpmar6a%2BjJ%2Bpop2emcBuvsSupaKnnmKwornEqGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
