When done sparingly&nbsp;and correctly, plastic surgery can enhance a star's natural beauty without drawing too much attention to the subtle changes in their appearance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We're definitely&nbsp;not here to bash those who want to undergo a&nbsp;tweak here or&nbsp;there, but sometimes, celebrities go way too far in their quest for&nbsp;perfection. They become addicted to reshaping&nbsp;their faces and bodies, and quite often, they're never truly satisfied with the results. They then become repeat plastic surgery patients, and the subsequent procedures turn their once youthful faces into tragic monstrosities. You know the look: tight faces, eyebrows pulled high onto their foreheads, skin that resembles plastic, oversized lips, and breasts that look like they're desperately trying&nbsp;to run away from each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For most celebrities who undergo plastic surgery, they actually looked ten times better before going under the knife, and their new botched appearance only garners more negative tabloid and gossip magazine coverage. But with a pipeline of money in their bank accounts, and access to some of the top&nbsp;plastic surgeons in the world, going in for a procedure or two is far too tempting for the majority of Hollywood stars. This list of&nbsp;10 celebrities who have botched their faces and bodies to the point of being almost unrecognizable has us wishing they had stopped after procedure number one.</p><h2 id=10-rose-mcgowan><strong>10. Rose McGowan</strong></h2><p>While many celebrities use plastic surgery to enhance their looks, actress <a href=#>Rose McGowan</a> was forced to go&nbsp;under the knife after a terrible car accident in 2007. McGowan was the passenger in a vehicle when another car came out of nowhere and hit them. The eyeglasses she was wearing at the time sliced into the skin underneath her eye, so the actress underwent multiple cosmetic procedures in an attempt to restore her beauty.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many fans have taken notice to the now drastic changes her face has undergone, and at one point, a few&nbsp;of her Instagram followers&nbsp;teased her&nbsp;by saying she now looks like Michael Jackson. McGowan rarely brings up the accident to naysayers,&nbsp;so we have to wonder if that was the real reason behind her plastic surgery procedures.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-megan-fox><strong>9. Megan Fox</strong></h2><p>When <a href=#>Megan Fox</a> emerged onto the scene and captured the eyes of moviegoers in the 2007 movie Transformers, fans were mesmerized by her striking good looks, beautiful blue eyes, and shiny brown hair. But as the years progressed, Fox's features began to change, and it's pretty obvious she has had multiple cosmetic procedures done to&nbsp;her face. Leading plastic surgeons have pointed out a slight nose refinement to make her nose slimmer, as well as reconstructive surgery on the tip of the nose. Her lips are definitely fuller, and it looks as if she has added cheek implants to help chisel out her features. Although Fox may be satisfied with the way she looks today, we definitely think she looked more beautiful pre-surgery.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-lil-kim><strong>8. Lil' Kim</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After emerging on the scene in the 90s alongside Puff Daddy and The Notorious B.I.G., <a href=#>Lil Kim</a>'s baby face&nbsp;took the world by surprise as she recited some of the most raunchiest lyrics in hip-hop. But with fame came the pressure to be perfect, and in Kim's eyes, that meant a&nbsp;complete tweak of her entire&nbsp;body. She has admitted to multiple nose jobs after domestic violence altercations, but she has never came clean about the obvious brow lift, facelift, lip injections, breast augmentation, and body sculpting. These days, the Queen Bee is looking unrecognizable, and we can't help but reminisce about her once beautiful and youthful appearance.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-lara-flynn-boyle><strong>7. Lara Flynn Boyle</strong></h2><p>Actress <a href=#>Lara Flynn Boyle</a> has never copped to having plastic surgery, but one look at her before and after pictures show that she has had extensive facial work done. Her once smooth skin and striking features have been marred by a suspected&nbsp;rhinoplasty, lip augmentation, face&nbsp;fillers, and a facelift. In current pictures, the star's once supple skin is&nbsp;now puffy and sagging. Someone should have begged her to stop with the procedures years ago!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=6-aubrey-o-day><strong>6. Aubrey O'Day</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Aubrey O'Day</a> was your typical California girl when she was chosen as one of the lucky winners of Puff Daddy's Making the Band&nbsp;reality television show. But as quickly as O'Day was pushed into the limelight, she began to crack under pressure, and the multiple plastic surgery procedures slowly changed her appearance from wholesome to WTF. Although the singer swears she hasn't gone under the knife, comparison photographs tell a different story. Her nose is much thinner, her face is tighter, her breasts are bigger, and she's toting around a brand new booty. She almost looks like an alien at this point.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-khloe-kardashian><strong>5. Khloe Kardashian</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With the chants of "ugly sister" ringing through TD Garden&nbsp;during a Dallas Mavericks vs. Boston Celtics game, <a href=#>Khloe Kardashian</a> must have felt humiliated and crushed to be taunted and ridiculed for her looks. Even Eminem called her "the ugly Kardashian," and posing in between her ridiculously beautiful sisters clearly didn't make her feel any better about herself. Kardashian has since undergone multiple transformations that have morphed her into a plastic version of her former self. She has definitely plumped her lips and her butt. Her new curves are likely the results of liposuction, and we don't doubt her new face is full of fillers and botox. Maybe she wasn't the most gorgeous Kardashian, but she was more real than her pretentious sisters. But now, with her new chiseled face and overly-contoured body, she has fallen victim to the pressures of&nbsp;the industry, and that alone would make&nbsp;us choose&nbsp;her pre-surgery body over her new manmade body any day.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=4-kim-kardashian><strong>4. Kim Kardashian</strong></h2><p>It wouldn't be a plastic surgery list without Khloe's big sister, <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a>. In just a few short years, Kim went from being Paris Hilton's sidekick to being an international superstar. Aside from her questionable fashion choices (and that horrid sex tape,) Kim's ability to stay on the cover of magazines is due to her ever-changing appearance. The reality star has completely erased her ethnic features, and she's now sporting a racially ambiguous face. Although she denies going under the knife, her before and after pictures reveal a nose job, possible cheek and chin implants, a facelift, brow lift, breast augmentation, liposuction, body contouring, and butt injections. We definitely think Kim was more beautiful pre-international fame, but we don't think she will be slowing down with the plastic surgery procedures any time soon.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-sylvester-stallone><strong>3. Sylvester Stallone</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Sylvester Stallone</a>, the actor behind the legendary Rocky movies, is one actor who has not aged gracefully. There has been a lot of speculation about the procedures he has had done, but he has never gone on the record to confirm any plastic surgery. Despite old age taking a toll on his body, an obvious forehead lift and fillers have drastically changed the appearance of his face, and it doesn't look pretty!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=2-kylie-jenner><strong>2. Kylie Jenner</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a> was rumored to have had a few plastic surgery procedures long before her 18th birthday, and we wouldn't be surprised if that was the case. Growing up with a family that&nbsp;places such a strong emphasis on their appearance&nbsp;definitely took a toll on Jenner. In just a couple years, she went from an average teenager to a bonafide sex symbol - complete with massive lip injections, a possible browlift, and fillers.</p><p>Jenner has only confessed to having lip injections, and she claims the rest of her drastic change in appearance is due to makeup and using dark contouring makeup to chisel her features. This was the same excuse her big sister Kim Kardashian used for years before finally admitting to getting fillers and injections in her face. But the difference between Kim and Kylie is that Kylie is a little more thirsty for fame, so we're looking forward to the day when she cops to all the procedures she has undergone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=1-lindsay-lohan><strong>1. Lindsay Lohan</strong></h2><p>Lindsay Lohan was the epitome of beauty as a precocious child actress in Freaky Friday, and a budding sex symbol in Mean Girls. But her quick&nbsp;rise to fame, constant tabloid and paparazzi attention, and years of hard partying have prompted the star to completely&nbsp;change her looks. Her cute, freckled face is now bloated, her lips have been pumped to capacity, and she's sporting a pair of lopsided breast implants. Her body changes have severely impacted her&nbsp;promising acting career. Lohan isn't even 30 yet, but she looks old, worn out, and haggard. We wonder if she misses her old looks as much as we do?</p><p>Sources: <a href=#>usmagazine.com</a>, <a href=#>celebuzz.com</a>, <a href=#>huffingtonpost.com</a>, <a href=#>radaronline.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZmpoXZiyrbHBq6CtoZWoeri0zmajqKebmrFursStq56qXZeyp7vRnmSppJGowaqvjKysq5%2BVp8Zw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
