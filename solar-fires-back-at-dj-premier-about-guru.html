Solar has been mired in criticism over his handling of Guru (born Keith Elam) while he was alive, and also after his passing on April 19.</p><p>The 7 Grand Records Owner was accused of forging Guru’s death bed letter, preventing Guru’s family from seeing him, and alienating him from his former <strong>Gang Starr </strong>groupmate.</p><p>Premier alleged that when he visited Guru in the hospital, the rapper was unkempt with his toes and finger nails not clipped, and his face unshaven.</p><p>“Guru was cared for in the CCU at their highest level of care for a patient in his condition. I was at the hospital every day — some days numerous times to check on Guru,” Solar said in the statement. “He was always clean and well attended, too. Guru was in a room equipped with around-the-clock video surveillance as well as hospital personnel. Premier’s visit can be easily verified. The hospital has a strict visiting policy which includes signing in to see a patient. The CCU has an even stricter policy which is very thoroughly enforced.”</p><p>Solar says that he is going to verify Primo’s presence at the hospital by checking surveillance.</p><p>“They will most certainly ask what day this visit took place and what time did he visit to facilitate process. My people and I would never tolerate any mistreatment of Guru in any way, shape or form,” Solar said. “Did DJ Premier complain to the hospital authorities about what he claims he saw?! If so who were the hospital authority? [sic] What was their response?” —Starrene Rhett</p><p><strong><span>SEE ALSO:&nbsp;<a href=#>DJ Premier Opens Up About Guru’s Death, Solar, Gang Starr Reunion & More</a></span></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6i8ra3RZp2iqpWoeqOtwqRknaJdpb%2BmucieqWaZkqTCtXnGrqmuZWVngXqFjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
