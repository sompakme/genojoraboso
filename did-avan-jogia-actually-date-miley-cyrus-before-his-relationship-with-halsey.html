While one coupling may have just been a fling that dates back a decade, the other one has the potential to be something serious. This is also why Jogia and Halsey are getting the attention of fans.</p><p>Jogia's dating history is short, but it could be about to get a lot more interesting. And now that his star is on the rise, fans may be hearing a lot more about him in the future.</p><h2 id=who-is-avan-jogia>Who Is Avan Jogia?</h2><p>Canadian actor and singer Avan Jogia is fast becoming one of the hottest talents, having landed a role in the 2023 film, Choose Love. Some of his past work includes the 2019 films Shaft and Zombieland: Double Tap. His first acting role is believed to date back to 2006 with the television movie A Girl Like Me: The Gwen Araujo Story. But he has also appeared in The Nickelodeon show Victorious.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/avan-jogia.jpg><p>Despite this being a hugely popular show, Jogia's thoughts on being a Nickelodeon actor are complicated.</p><p>"<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I don't look back on (Nickelodeon) fondly</a>. But I do think it's interesting to see just what it means to people. It's touching, but also it's out of your control," he told Teen Vogue in a 2023 interview. "I feel like I represent sadness for people because they can sort of look at me and be like, 'Oh, right. I remember when I used to be young and things weren't so complicated.' It's like, I represent an uncomplicated time. Sometimes I think that I have a strong desire to keep that image safe for them."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's not just Jogia's acting career that is getting noticed, but also his love life. And he has already been linked to some famous women. His list of past girlfriends includes actresses Cleopatra Coleman, Zoey Deutch, and, <a href=#>most recently, musician Halsey</a>. But where does the chatter surrounding himself and Miley Cyrus come in?</p><h2 id=what-was-miley-cyrus-39-s-relationship-with-avan-jogia>What Was Miley Cyrus's Relationship With Avan Jogia?</h2><p>Miley Cyrus is now in a relationship with Maxx Morando, but before their coupling, she was briefly linked to Avan Jogia. And when we say linked, we cannot confirm this was more than a very brief fling, at best. The pair reportedly spent time together in 2013 at Cyrus's 18th birthday party.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Miley Cyrus Is So Low-Key About Her Drummer Boyfriend, Maxx Morando</a></span></p><p>Reports claimed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jogia and Cyrus shared a kiss at this party</a>. "She had such a good time [at her party]," a source told People (via Chicago Tribune). "She was so happy and having so much fun just dancing nonstop, surrounded by all of her friends. It was the party she was hoping for."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There was also photographic evidence of Jogia kissing her neck, but a source claimed they were "getting to know each other – that's really it right now."</p><p>Very little evidence suggests that things between them ever progressed beyond this point, and they are not considered each other's exes. So, if they did date, it was incredibly brief and uneventful. Still, that doesn't mean that the actor's most recent coupling is just as unexciting, and things between himself and Halsey appear to be heating up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/miley-cyrus.jpg><p>As for Cyrus? She has had some high-profile romances, but she has also had some low-key ones. Speaking of dating, she discussed her views on partners in an episode of the "Call Her Daddy" podcast (via Insider).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Female relationships make more sense to me because the role that I was in made more sense because it was like, 'Well, there's not going to be this weird thing of, like, well, I pay for everything,'" she said – fans will remember she was previously linked to Stella Maxwell and Kaitlynn Carter.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Miley Cyrus Hints That She'll Never Tour Again As She Admits It's Bad For Her Mental Health</a></span></p><p>She has also spoken about her struggles with dating in the spotlight and how others feel they have a right to comment on it. "I know the public feels invested in my past relationship because they felt like they saw it thru from the beginning," she wrote in a social media post.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/did-avan-jogia-actually-date-miley-cyrus-before-his-relationship-with-halsey_-all-3-please.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I think that's why people have always felt so entitled over my life and how I live it because they've watched me grow up. But I am grown now and make choices as an adult, knowing the truth/details/reality. People only 'know' what they see on the internet."</p><h2 id=are-halsey-and-avan-jogia-in-a-relationship>Are Halsey And Avan Jogia In A Relationship?</h2><p>In recent months, there has been much speculation about Halsey and Avan Jogia's relationship status. Their current public display of affection seemed to prove that they are, in fact, dating. Per Page Six, they were seen holding hands, kissing, and looking very content at the Cara Hotel in Los Feliz, Los Angeles. The publication also claims they were previously spotted together in Barcelona, Spain, in June 2023.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/The-Truth-About-Halseys-Health-Issues.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Very few details are known about the new coupling, and at present, neither Halsey nor Jogia have made a statement about their relationship. They are also not Instagram official (which is considered a dating milestone in modern times).</p><p>We do know that the new relationship comes not long after Halsey split with her ex-boyfriend, writer and producer, Alev Aydin (with whom she shares a child). The previous couple were first linked in 2018, but their relationship is only believed to have been romantic from 2020. They broke up in 2023. "It's an amicable split," a source told People at the time of their breakup. "They're planning to co-parent."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Really Happened Between Matty Healy And His Ex-Girlfriend Halsey?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Their split was completely amicable," a source told HollywoodLife shared. "And she only filed for sole custody because she's going on tour, and Ender will be with them. But they are planning to co-parent their son together. It was just a formality that needed to be done so she could take Ender with them."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdlsOiuoyjpqChkWKxosDEZqSipJWueqTF0a6qZpqVm7yzsYyrnKWZpJ68r7%2FHoqdmr5mptW60wKWqnrFf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
