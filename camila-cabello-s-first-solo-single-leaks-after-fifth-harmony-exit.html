Camila Cabello's first solo single, &#34;Love Incredible,&#34; has leaked online, one month after she left Fifth Harmony.
The song features Norwegian producer Cashmere Cat — who has also worked with Ariana Grande, Britney Spears, The Weeknd, Selena Gomez and Kanye West — and is a crossover of pop, R&B and dance, like many of Fifth Harmony's biggest hits. &#34;Love Incredible&#34; starts mellow, but picks up with a thumping drumbeat once the chorus hits."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"Love Incredible" starts mellow, but picks up with a thumping drumbeat once the chorus hits.</p><p>"This love's incredible, credible / Have a little mercy on me, baby, you got me," Cabello, 19, sings. "Wanting more, wanting more of your love."</p><p>It is unclear if "Love Incredible" is a track from the Cuban American songstress' first solo album or Cashmere Cat's forthcoming record, <i>Wild Love</i>. Either way, it marks Cabello's first official song as a solo artist, though she had recorded features for other artists while still a member of Fifth Harmony. Last year, Cabello collaborated with <b>Machine Gun Kelly</b> on his ballad "Bad Things."</p><span class=caption></span><p>Fifth Harmony, meanwhile, <a href=#>performed for the first time as a quartet</a> earlier this month at the 2017 People's Choice Awards. Remaining members <b>Lauren Jauregui</b>, <b>Normani Kordei</b>, <b>Dinah Jane Hansen</b> and <b>Ally Brooke Hernandez</b>, who have already begun recording new music without Cabello, wowed the audience with a dance-heavy performance of their 2016 hit "Work From Home." They were scheduled to sing the national anthem at the NHL All-Star Game on Sunday, January 29, but were forced to cancel at the last minute after Hansen, 19, "became sick and had to be treated by paramedics," <a href=#>TMZ</a> reported.</p><p>The girl group, which was formed on season 2 of <i>The X Factor</i> in 2012, announced on social media on December 18, 2016, that <a href=#>Cabello had left the group</a>. In an icy statement, the girls claimed they had been informed of the budding solo artist's departure "via her representatives," but Cabello later <a href=#>denied the allegation in a message of her own</a>. "I did not intend to end things with Fifth Harmony this way," she wrote.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Listen to "Love Incredible" below!</p><p>https://youtube.com/watch?v=7PDE8xXK55g</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacmZ2euaJ5wpqZnqScpMBussirqq1lo6S5sHnSoqWgpJViuaatyqxkmp6kmr9ussifq6FlmJa%2FrrvNsmSesJmperiAlWxuaW1f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
