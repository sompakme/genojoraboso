You're kind of discouraged about yourself and then the weight gain too, or that makes me more depressed," he said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Although the father of five shed 30 pounds on the reality program, he appears to have gained the weight back.</p><p>His ex<strong> Shar Jackson</strong> told Us Weekly in 2010 Federline's fuller figure was "daddy weight!"
