Is there any better feeling in the world than kicking off your shoes after a long and busy day? It’s such a relief! As fabulous as it feels to take a load off and rest your feet, there might be a bigger issue happening here. The type of shoes you wear may be part of the problem, and if you’re dealing with serious foot pain or minor aches here and there, a pair of orthopedic shoes may be the key to getting back on track."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It’s such a relief! As fabulous as it feels to take a load off and rest your feet, there might be a bigger issue happening here. The type of shoes you wear may be part of the problem, and if you’re dealing with serious foot pain or minor aches here and there, a pair of orthopedic shoes may be the key to getting back on track.</p><p>We know what you might be thinking — aren’t orthopedic shoes reserved for those of a certain age? Throw that common misconception out the window! There are orthopedic shoes on the market which appear to be designed primarily for comfort, but there are plenty of options that fit any shopper’s needs in both the support and style departments. Now that the weather is getting warmer, we’re shopping for sandals — more specifically ones that our feet will feel the most comfortable in.</p><p><strong>Tim Everett</strong>, who is an <a href=# rel=noopener>expert osteopath</a> with 20 years of experience under his belt, notes he would “recommend arch support sandals to patients with plantar fasciitis to help support their arch and relieve pain.” Plantar fasciitis is a particular ailment that occurs in the sole that makes feet more prone to pain, but the same is true for anyone who wants to relieve any unnecessary stress that their feet might experience while wearing a pair of sandals.</p><h2>Our Favorite Comfortable Orthopedic Sandals</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/orthopedic-sandals-oofos-oolala.jpg><p>If you want to step into your shoes and feel immediate relief, a pair of OOFOS should 100% be in your future. The foam sole of this sandal is curved to support the movement of your foot while walking, and the OOfoam technology claims to absorb 37% more impact than traditional footwear. We can see why these have earned the American Podiatric Medical Association Seal of Acceptance!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">OOFOS OOlala Sandal</a> starting at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$75</a>, available at Amazon! <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break">Please note, prices are accurate at the date of article update, January 8, 2024, but are subject to change.</span></strong></p><h2>What Are Orthopedic Sandals?</h2><p>Orthopedic sandals don’t fall into one singular category or style — there are tons of different orthopedic elements that a pair of sandals can have that boost their supreme comfort level. Here are a few of the characteristics that we searched for when shopping for the absolute best pairs:</p><ul><li><strong>Arch Support</strong>: Flat sandals just will not do! We wanted to make sure that the soles of these shoes are curved to fit the natural arches and curves of the foot, which help make the shoe all the more comfortable.</li><li><strong>High-Quality Materials</strong>: Each of the sandals we found are made from materials designed to help your feet absorb shock while walking.</li><li><strong>Supportive and Comfortable Design</strong>: We made sure that the straps on these shoes won’t pinch your toes and provide the proper amount of ankle support if that’s what you need from your footwear!</li></ul><h2>12 More Comfortable Orthopedic Sandals That We Adore</h2><h4>KuaiLu Orthotic Slides</h4><p>A can’t-fail slide style heavy on comfort and low on cost — KuaiLu’s popular sandals never disappoint!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/orthopedic-sandals-kuailu-slides.jpg><p>These slides are a hit on Amazon thanks to their orthopedic arch support to reduce back and heel pain.
