While the high school sweethearts split shortly after, the former couple <a href=#>continue to coparent</a>.</p><p>Rivera said during a November 2020 episode of his ex’ “Baby Mama No Drama” podcast that he <a href=#>“didn’t fight hard enough”</a> for custody of their baby boy, calling himself “naive” at the time.</p><p>“I don’t feel like there was ever any reason for him not to be with me,” he explained. “I didn’t know my rights, what I deserved to have, what my son deserve[d] to have. I was just trying to get what I could.”</p><p>Lowry went on to marry <a href=#><strong>Javi Marroquin</strong></a> in 2012 and give birth to son Lincoln the following year. She and the Marine divorced in 2016, and the “Coffee Convos” podcast cohost expanded her family with<a href=#> <strong>Chris Lopez</strong></a>.</p><p>The 16 and Pregnant alum and Lopez share sons Lux and Creed, born in 2017 and 2020, respectively. In June 2023, Lowry revealed she <a href=#>welcomed her fifth child</a> one year prior. Though she had been romantically linked to <a href=#><strong>Elijah Scott</strong></a> at the time, Lowry did not share the identity of the baby’s father.</p><p>Before baby no. 5’s arrival, Lowry often shared her mixed feelings about having more kids. She revealed during a <a href=#>Teen Mom 2</a> reunion in July 2021 that she was <a href=#>fre</a><a href=#>e</a><a href=#>zing her eggs</a> amid her polycystic ovary syndrome diagnosis.</p><p>“I’m not even saying I would have more [kids], I just want the possibility, if five years from now, I do meet the love of my life and we want to have kids, I have healthy eggs,” the A Letter of Love author said at the time. “I was doing [egg harvesting] first, and I’m glad I started doing it, because then I found out <a href=#>I have PCOS</a>.”</p><p>Later that year, the reality star began&nbsp;focusing on <a href=#>building a home</a> for her children.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I was so excited to take all the kids to our new property yesterday,” the Pride Over Pity author told her Instagram followers in September 2021. “I know they’re young and can’t fully understand what it means for me to be able to do this. But I was blown away by their excitement and pleasantly surprised by the appreciation they had for the progress being made. I am so so so excited for this journey.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see the<a href=#> Marriage Boot Camp</a> alum bonding with her kids, from family vacations to fall outings.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkwaaxzWakqKVdZ8But8Cio7KmXaG8uL7YrGSfmZ2eubp5wKWZrqVdrLa1tIyhnKtlo6S7tHnOr5yrZaSdsm7FxJqprGWgnby1u9Jo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
