She began using the phrase in the early 2000s and its origin is pretty close to home.</p><p>“The 2000s were all about <a href=#><strong>Britney Spears</strong></a>, boy bands. It was all about monograms and labels, like Chanel and Dior and Louis Vuitton,” Hilton, 38, told <a href=#>Vogue</a> in an interview on Wednesday, December 18, when talking about the fashions of the early ‘00s. “I feel like everybody just had really fun with their fashion choices. I think it was just all about being super extra.”</p><p>The heiress explained that she’s always been “obsessed with wearing lots of pink and sparkles” before noting that T-shirts in this era started to have her go-to phrase printed on them, which added to the “super extra” vibes.</p><p>“Then they started making shirts that said, ‘That’s hot,’ and on the back it would say, ‘You’re not.’ It’s cute,” <a href=#>The Simple Life alum</a> told the magazine.</p><p>The catchphrase, however, wasn’t from Hilton herself, but, instead, from a family member. “’That’s Hot’ is something that my sister, <a href=#><strong>[Nicky Hilton Rothschild]</strong></a>, actually always used to say,” she admitted. “But I trademarked it and I own it. Sorry, Nicky.”</p><p>The New York native also opened up to the fashion magazine about her love of the Juicy Couture tracksuit which was a staple in the early ‘00s.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Paris-Hilton-Reveals-the-Unexpected-Origin-of-Her-Thats-Hot-Catchphrase-02.jpg><p>“As soon as I put on my first Juicy tracksuit, I was obsessed,” she told the publication. “I just fell in love with the brand and it basically became my uniform. I have an entire closet that’s only Juicy Couture.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The “Stars Are Blind” singer previously discussed her <a href=#>extensive Juicy tracksuit collection</a> in an October interview with <a href=#>The Guardian</a>.</p><p>“My everyday wear is very comfortable,” Hilton told the British publication. “I love Juicy Couture’s velour tracksuits — I probably own 100 of them in every color. That’s my uniform when I’m chilling at home or going to the beach — anything that doesn’t involve a red carpet.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatoJVivLO1xqKlZqeWYr2ivsisZKGhnKm8r7%2BMrZ%2BarKNitbDAjJyYrZuYpbWzrdKeZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
