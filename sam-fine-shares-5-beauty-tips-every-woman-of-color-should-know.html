“Women of color disproportionately spend money on cosmetics, yet often aren’t spoken to,” says makeup artist Sam Fine, who is known for his work on African-American celebrities like Vanessa Williams and Tyra Banks – and is also the author of “Fine: The Basics of Beauty.”
The celebrity makeup artist took a stroll with us through Duane Reade – which is New York City’s most prolific drugstore – and revealed his favorite budget buys while spilling the essential beauty tips he believes every woman of color should have in her arsenal."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Set brows with powder.</strong> Deeper-complected women naturally have darker brows, which means you’ll shape and fill in sparse areas with shades ranging from brown to dark espresso. Such dark color drawn right on the skin will stand out obviously unless you temper it down with a quick setting of powder that will make brows look more authentic. “You don’t need to necessarily match a powder to your brow pencil, you can just use the pressed powder you’d use on your face,” says Fine, who adds that he prefers Maybelline pencils and powders.</p><p><strong>2. Don’t cover freckles.</strong> When applying foundation, your aim should never be to cover freckles – not only do they add character, but you’ll risk looking too ‘done’ if they’re opaquely painted over. “Tyra Banks loves her freckles so much that she’ll go back with an eyeliner pencil if she feels they’ve been too covered by makeup,” divulges Fine.</p><p><strong>3. Prime bold lips first.</strong> Deeper tones can pull off beautiful splashes of color on the lips glamorously – but there’s nothing less attractive than a cracked and crumbly loud lip. Fine slips a layer of Aquaphor on his clients first, and then begins working on their makeup. By the time he gets to the pout, the hydration has soaked in and left lips silky, smooth and ready for a pop of color.</p><p><strong>Get the rest of the tips at </strong><a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>StyleList</strong></a><strong>!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6iurnnFoqWeZaOdrrOx0mZsZpqVlsK1xYytoKmrXZrDpr7YZq6opZGjeqS7y6ipZquYpMKtsIykpaivXWqCcYKPaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
