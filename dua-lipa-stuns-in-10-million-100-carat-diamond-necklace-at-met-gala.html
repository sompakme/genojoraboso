The pop star accessorized with Tiffany & Co’s Lucida Star necklace. Featuring 100 carats of diamonds, the piece is <a href=#>reportedly worth $10 million.</a> Even more impressive, Dua is the first person to ever wear the piece.</p><p>The Lucida Star necklace was inspired by the Tiffany Diamond, which is one of the largest and priciest yellow diamonds available.</p><p>That wasn’t the only impressive piece of jewelry Dua wore to the iconic event. She also <a href=#>dazzled in a Tiffany & Co. platinum ring set</a> featuring over 9 carats of diamonds, including the Schlumberger Sixteen Stone Ring featuring white diamonds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 2023 MET Gala’s theme was "Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty," which paid tribute to late Chanel creative director Karl Lagerfeld, who passed away in February 2019.</p><p>Of the theme, <a href=#>the MET Museum explained</a> , “Focusing on the designer’s stylistic vocabulary as expressed in aesthetic themes that appear time and again in his fashions from the 1950s to his final collection in 2019, the show will spotlight the German-born designer’s unique working methodology."</p><p>Dua was right on-theme with her vintage Chanel ball gown and stunning jewelry. But she was hardly the only celebrity to turn heads with her glittering accessories.</p><p>For example, Gigi Hadid made waves for <a href=#>wearing a haute joaillerie necklace with more than 74-carats</a> of lab grown diamonds. The stunning piece featured 6-carats of diamonds in a pear shape at the center, surrounded by a series of smaller stones.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gigi also accessorized with a collection of diamond rings from the brand plus a pearl necklace designed by Lagos, which was a nod to Lagerfeld, who often featured pearls in his Chanel collections.</p><p>Though Gigi’s jewelry may have featured almost as many carats of diamonds as Dua’s, it was likely much lower in price since it was lab-grown. Artificial diamonds are increasing in popularity, not only due to accessibility and lower cost but also ethical reasons. And with celebs like Gigi Hadid proudly rocking them on the red carpet, they’re likely only going to become more popular.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp; <a href=#>Elon Musk To Spend $2 Billion On Starship After Last One Exploded</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Something About Rocks</a>, <a href=#>Harper’s Bazaar</a>, <a href=#>MET Museum</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8OumGakmaWubr%2FTrqWsZZmjenJ8jKagpaSZpLtufY9pZJyZopbBbrDImqSoppRiu6avyqWYnJ1dlsFuucStZKCZnJZ8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
