I think it was the first part that I had gotten after the show.”</p><p>Soon after, Davis starred in Robert Rodriguez’s family adventure The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D, which stars a young Taylor Lautner as one of the titular characters. In the film, Davis plays a mom whose son (Cayden Boyd) gets recruited by his imaginary friends to help save their planet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For the actress, the film made for the perfect project since she’s always wanted to work with Rodriguez. “I would have said yes to anything that Robert would ever ask me to do because all actors know about Robert and respect Robert and know his creativity and that he's a lovely person,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Davis told Radio Free Entertainment</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's How Fans Feel About Nicole Ari Parker Joining 'And Just Like That...'</a></span></p><p>Davis also went on to star in films such as Soccer Moms, Deck the Halls, Couples Retreat, and Journey 2: The Mysterious Island with Dwayne Johnson.

It was the comedy series Bad Teacher which centers on a woman (played by Ari Graynor) who decides to become a teacher to find an ideal man for herself. Davis was cast to play Ginny, one of Graynor’s fellow teachers.</p><p>For Graynor, there was no better castmate to have than Davis. “I love Kristin. She is such a sweetheart, and such a support,” Graynor told Collider.</p><p>“This was all new for me. This is the first time I’ve done a series, and she’s had so much experience. She was really wonderful with advice and being there.” Bad Teacher was canceled after one season.</p><h2 id=eventually-kristin-davis-made-her-way-to-netflix-too>Eventually, Kristin Davis Made Her Way To Netflix Too</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As she continued to pursue more film roles, Davis decided to star in Netflix’s holiday film Holiday in the Wild alongside Rob Lowe. The two actors haven’t worked together again since they starred together in the '90s miniseries Atomic Train. For Lowe, this was the perfect opportunity to work together again.</p><p>“When I knew it was her, I was like, ‘I’m in! I love her!’” the actor told Collider. Davis remarked, “It’s such a joy, in our business, that it’s such a small world that sometimes you do get to reunite with the people that you would like to reunite with. It’s wonderful.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Behind-The-Scenes Photos From ‘And Just Like That…’ Explained</a></span></p><p>At the same time, Davis made (sort of) a cameo in Netflix’s other holiday film, The Knight Before Christmas.
