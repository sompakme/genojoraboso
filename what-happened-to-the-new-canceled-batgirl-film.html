It had a strong emphasis on building streaming subscriptions for HBO Max through original content.</p><p>This included the controversial decision to release Warner Bros' entire 2021 theatrical slate including Dune, Godzilla Vs Kong, King Richard and The Matrix Resurrections on HBO MAX instead of making them cinema exclusive.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Twitter Roasts âDuneâ Creator For Complaining About HBO Max Release ">Twitter Roasts ‘Dune’ Creator For Complaining About HBO Max Release</a></span></p><p>It looks like Zaslav wants to concentrate on big screen releases, yet Batgirl was not considered big enough to have a theatrical release.

This means they have been forced to tighten their belts and find cost-saving measures where possible.</p><p>The decision to scrap Batgirl and Scoob, both almost completed movies appears to be an accounting loophole. It looks like the media giants can scrap these movies without having to carry the losses on its books. As a company that has recently changed hands, they apparently had until mid-August the exercise this option.</p><p>Because it is being used as a tax-write off, we will never be able to see it. There is now no way for HBO MAX to release the comic book movie.</p><h2 id=how-batgirl-filmmakers-found-out-about-warner-bros-canceling-the-movie><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>How Batgirl Filmmakers Found Out About Warner Bros Canceling The Movie</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Batgirl directors weren't given too much warning about this cancelation before we all learned about it.
