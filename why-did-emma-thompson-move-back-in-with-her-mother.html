It was only following the UK's famous Brexit vote to leave the European Union in 2016 that she and her husband Greg Wise began taking the idea more seriously. Both were commited 'Remainers' and opposed the vote, and the political vote only increased their desire to move to Europe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking disparagingly of her home country, Emma described it as, “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A tiny little cloud-bolted, rainy corner of sort-of Europe, a cake-filled misery-laden grey old island</a>.” She claimed to feel an affinity for Europe she has never felt in the UK, “I feel European even though I live in Great Britain and in Scotland."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Claudia Schiffer Appeared In Love Actually</a></span></p><h2 id=the-couple-moved-to-venice-in-2020><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The Couple Moved To Venice In 2020</span></h2><p>The couple just beat the pandemic when they made the big move to Venice in February 2020. They bought a beautiful home in the famous city, and were apparently taking lots of Italian lessons in advance of emigrating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-couple-became-italian-citizens><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>The Couple Became Italian Citizens</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Proving how seriously the couple were taking their decision, they even decided to become Italian citizens</a>, and used their Italian lessons when signing the official documents. Beaming, Emma said that it had been “the realisation of a dream she had cherished for years.”</p><p>Deputy mayor Simone Venturini added: “They wanted to be resident citizens to come and live in Venice... They bought in the historic centre, not a second home. We are truly happy and proud to have Emma Thompson and Greg Wise as our fellow citizens, for what they represent and for the love they show for Venice.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Rob Schneider Turned Down This Adam Sandler Film</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=things-changed-when-the-pandemic-hit-however><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Things Changed When The Pandemic Hit, However</span></h2><p>Everything was going well for the two actors, and they were enjoying their new life together in Southern Europe. When the COVID-19 pandemic began to take hold shortly after their move however, things changed rapidly. Italy suffered terribly during the early months of the crisis, and Emma and Greg were forced to return to their native Britain, leaving their new home and life in Italy behind.</p><h2 id=they-had-to-move-in-with-emma-39-s-mother><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>They Had To Move In With Emma's Mother</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following their return back to Britain, Emma had to isolate with family on the bank of Loch Eck in Argyll, Scotland. She didn't seem to be disappointed by having to live back at her Mum's place, however, and expressed in an interview with the BBC just how fond she is of the place, which she has spent time in and enjoyed since she was young. She said: “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I’ve played on its banks, picnicked on its beaches, swum in its chilly, unsalted depths, cycled round it, drunk it, kissed in boats on it, married near it, never wearied it</a>.”</p><p>So it wasn't such a bad place to have to spend lockdown, though the weather probably wasn't as nice as Italy's. She did, however, say that she found Scotland rather oppressive, and wasn't surprised that actors and creatives tended to move away from the place. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking in an interview with The Herald,</a> she said: “There’s nobody more f****** joy-sucking than one of those old Scotsmen who hates pleasure in all its forms. I understand why so many Scottish artists and actors leave. They have to, because they can’t get any air, they feel stifled."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-has-she-been-doing-since><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>What Has She Been Doing Since?</span></h2><p>Its been a tough time for the couple, but they've come through the experience smiling, and are busier than ever with new work opportunities. Husband Greg will be taking part in this year's British TV show Strictly Come Dancing, where he will be paired with professional dancer Karen Hauer. Emma's been supportive of his decision to take part, and reportedly even 'burst into tears' when she saw him dance. The couple have been together for thirty years, and care deeply about each other's careers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Emma, meanwhile, whose Disney hit Cruella came out in Spring, is busy working on a new project called Good Luck to You, and has been cast as the villainous Miss Trunchbull in an upcoming film adaptation of the musical Matilda, which will be released in December next year.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Here's Why 'Matilda' Fans Aren't Totally On Board With Emma Thompson As Miss Trunchbull</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbalecSmpJplpJ28rrzSqKVmpZ%2Brsm6uwJyiZqGeYsSqwMdmn56qXaK8tbTEq2Slp6aaeqKv066YpaSpYra1rcuyZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
