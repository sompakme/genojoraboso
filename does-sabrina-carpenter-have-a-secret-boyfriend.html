Romance rumors have been circulating as the star has been linked to a bunch of guys over the years.

Are they dating?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sabrina-carpenter-s-real-relationship-with-joshua-basset>Sabrina Carpenter’s Real Relationship With Joshua Basset</h2><p>Sabrina, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who has an impressive $4 million net worth</a>, is pretty transparent on social media and even in interviews about her private life and, naturally, her fans are likely curious if she’s dating anyone right now. Most know she dated her fellow Disney Channel alum Bradley Steven Perry and was romantically involved with Corey Fogelmanis, Casey Cott, Bradley Simpson, and Griffin Gluck in the past.</p><p>Recently, however, she has been linked to High School Musical: The Musical: The Series star Joshua Basset after they were seen together at a Black Lives Matter protest in July 2020. Then in August that same year, they were spotted in Los Angeles while out for lunch. Romance rumors began to escalate even more in October that same year when the duo wore matching Halloween costumes. They dressed up as LavaGirl and Sharkboy, and they even posted a pile of TikTok videos together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Things We Know About Season 2 Of 'High School Musical: The Musical: The Series'</a></span></p><p>Early this year, a fan shared a photo of the two together in Park City, Utah. They may not have confirmed if they’re in a relationship, but these two stars clearly make a beautiful couple – and beautiful music together. In an interview with Radio.com, Sabrina teased her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">collaboration project with rumored boyfriend Joshua</a>, a song titled “We Both Know.”</p><p>Though the beauty was hesitant to divulge more details about the track, she did reveal that they recorded it “a while ago” and that she’s excited for everyone to hear it. She said, “I can’t say too much, and it’s on his project so I’m like, I don’t want to say too much that I can’t say.” She added that it’s a “collaboration very dear” to her heart and that she’s very excited about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, Joshua opened up about the project and revealed that he reached out to Sabrina via Instagram after penning down the song. He divulged, “I sent her a quick message and was like, ‘Hey, I think you’re really awesome and I have this song I think you would sound great on, let me know what you think,’ and she responded like 10 minutes later, gave me her number, and I sent her the song.”</p><h2 id=sabrina-carpenter-vs-olivia-rodrigo>Sabrina Carpenter Vs. Olivia Rodrigo</h2><p>The pair’s musical collaboration, however, was linked to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joshua’s split with girlfriend Olivia Rodrigo</a>. In early January, Olivia released a heartbreaking song as if referencing her past relationship with the young actor. A line from her track, “Drivers License,” reads, “You’re probably with that blonde girl.” Fans were quick to pinpoint the former Girl Meets World star Sabrina as the “blonde girl.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shortly after the release of Olivia’s debut single, Sabrina <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">seemingly responded to the message through her song, “Skin.”</a> Although she denied the claims that it is about Olivia, fans interpreted it the other way as the lyrics reads: “Maybe ‘blonde’ was the only rhyme.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Is Farkle From 'Girl Meets World' Trending, And What Does It Have To Do With Autism?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Writing on Instagram, Sabrina explained, “I wasn’t bothered by a few lines in a (magnificent) song and wrote a diss track about it. I was at a tipping point in my life for countless reasons so I was inspired to do what I usually do to cope, write something that I wish I could have told myself in the past.”</p><h2 id=joshua-bassett-s-coming-out-as-queer>Joshua Bassett’s Coming Out As Queer</h2><p>Just like any other love triangle feud, things might come to an end as rumors about Joshua’s sexuality skyrocketed on social media after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he gushed over Harry Styles</a>. While responding to a question about the singer in an interview, he flattered, “I think he’s a nice guy, doesn’t say too much, but when he talks, it matters. He’s just cool. Who doesn’t think Harry Styles is cool? Also, he’s hot, you know? He’s very charming too. Lots of things. This is also my coming out video, I guess.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His interview video went viral and caught the attention of fans. Answering all the queries, Joshua took on Twitter to express his idea. He wrote a letter that reads, “…Love who you love shamelessly. It’s ok to still be figuring out who you are. Life’s too short to let ignorance and hatred win. I choose love.”</p><p>Could this be the end of Sabrina Carpenter's alleged secret romance with Joshua Bassett?</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Comforting Decoration Does Sabrina Carpenter Bring To Every New House?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqmpqinruiecKaqamdnqmys3nBqLCfqpmau6V50p6aq52kYr%2B2uc6rZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
