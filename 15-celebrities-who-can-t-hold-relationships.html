That’s a thing, right? If there’s one thing that we can be sure on is that Hollywood will never run out of power couples, shocking love affairs or comically scripted A-list pairings. Whether it genuinely is true love, or a duo of big-shot Hollywood stars looking for a bit of media attention- these celebrities have had more than their fair share of high-status relationships and we have loved every moment of them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>Odd Celeb Couples That Are Probably Not Real Relationships</a></strong></p><p>A-listers love A-listers; and who could blame them? These beautiful specimens have created such eye-catching headlines over the years merely just for being a couple of down right gorgeous people! However, it really is the hopeless serial daters that we can never get enough of. From the train-crash flings we could spot from a mile away, to fairy-tale love stories between two insanely attractive celebrities that we ugly-cry for more often than not, these 15 celebrities love dipping their toes in the fame dating pool, however they just can’t seem to swim long enough to keep their lovers around.</p><h2 id=scarlett-johansson>Scarlett Johansson</h2><p>She may forever reign the title for most beautiful actress in the scene- but that doesn’t necessarily mean that <a href=#>Scarlett Johansson</a> is the most dateable. The gorgeous actress tends to keep her private life extremely isolated, so it would come to a surprise to know that the Hollywood heartthrob has actually had a lengthy list of partners (although, these relationships never really lasted long enough for her to parade around anyway).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From the universally adored <a href=#>Ryan Reynolds</a>, who actually wedded the beautiful blonde, to lover Jared Leto, Josh Harnett, Patrick Wilson and even superstar <a href=#>Justin Timberlake</a>! All such big names, yet no headlines? This actress sure knows how to keep her business in close hands. However, Johansson, despite such epic relationships, now walks the red carpet a single lady! Why? Something tells us our curvaceous star has a habit of putting her public foot before her private escapades- but we can’t help but love her nonetheless.</p><h2 id=cameron-diaz>Cameron Diaz</h2><p>The legendary actress has had her own fair share of flings and big-name affairs, however just can’t seem to keep them around! Diaz is classically beautiful; blonde hair, bright blue eyes and a captivating smile. So, we all know that attracting these men were never going to be an issue. Although, it may just be the kind of men that <a href=#>Cameron Diaz</a> attracts that are keeping her from settling down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her most serious lover to date was a sparkling relationship with Justin Timberlake. Diaz also captured the likes of stars like Paul Sculfor, John Mayer, Matt Dillon, Jared Leto and even mind freak, Chris Angel! Just a handful among the list, it can be assumed that perhaps our romantic celeb isn’t holding her relationships because she’s deathly drawn to the bad boys!</p><h2 id=jared-leto>Jared Leto</h2><p>Much like himself, <a href=#>Jared Leto</a> is undeniably attracted to young, gorgeous celebrities- and with a stare like that, it is no surprise that he has had his fair share of celebrity romances. However, little Leto seems to have a problem with commitment, because none of these sizzling affairs have ever put the star under their spell long enough for him to stay!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He’s never seen holding hands on the red carpet, nor has he openly called a significant other his “girlfriend”. Yet, he definitely doesn’t hide when being caught out with some of the most gorgeous celeb women in the business. From the dazzling likes of Cameron Diaz, Scarlett Johansson, Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, Ashley Olsen and even Paris Hilton! Leto has no trouble finding love with these star-striking hot shots, but for some reason can’t seem to settle down with any.</p><h2 id=lindsay-lohan>Lindsay Lohan</h2><p>If there’s one thing we do know about celebrity <a href=#>Lindsay Lohans</a> type of boy toy, it is that he always falls into the category of Musician and professional heart-throb. Starting with the man every teenager obsessed over in the early 2000’s, Aaron Carter, then stepping it up a notch with Wilmer Valderrama. Lohan had her eyes for the easily lovable- however turned out to be there for a good time, not a long time.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>Lindsay Lohan Claims She's 'Had Enough' With Dating</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From there, our fragile red-head went on to date celeb rockstars like Jared Leto, Ryan Adams, Harry Morton and Calum Best. Alas, our red-headed fame girl just couldn’t keep these men around, so she did what any (slightly loony) Hollywood star would do and opted out men for good, giving it a shot with Samantha Ronson- a fiery affair that fizzled out almost as quickly as it started. We love you anyway, Lindsay!</p><h2 id=katy-perry>Katy Perry</h2><p>The bad news is that it’s time to lose the misconception of <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> being the biggest serial dater in the celeb world. The good news? Make way for the extraordinary <a href=#>Katy Perry</a>! Also now know as Hollywood’s biggest serial celeb dater! Whilst the list is super extensive and quite the wild ride, let's focus on the wow-factors here.</p><p>We all know of Katy Perry’s ultimate love story with comedian and actor, Russel Brand. The two were happily married and grew to be a couple the entire world fell in love with. However, after their split, Katy Perry has hit Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber out of the ball park when it comes to celebrity dating, with love interests John Mayer, Jared Leto, Diplo, Robert Pattinson and current boy toy Orlando Bloom at the tip-top of the list!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=leonardo-dicaprio>Leonardo DiCaprio</h2><p>Unlike his Oscar winnings, famous actor Leonardo DiCaprio has had plenty of luck in the dating department of the years, giving him quite the “Modelizer” reputation. Our Leo has a penchant for bikini models and has made it clear through his long, long list of short flings and almost love affairs. From Bar Refaeli, Amber Valletta, Bijou Phillips and Gisele Bundchen and- these are just the beginning of Leo’s List. Lindsay Lohan, Juliette Lewis and Helena Christensen have also caught Titanic stars eyes- along with most recent gorgeous, 6 foot, Hollywood tailored gal pal Anne Vyalitsyna. Yet another model! But the list doesn’t end there.</p><p>DiCaprio had flings with Brittany Daniel and Bridget Hall (around the same time) and also reported to date Romeo and Juliet co-star Claire Danes during their film days together. At this rate, we could dedicate a whole new list just for Leos lovers!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paris-hilton>Paris Hilton</h2><p>Whether it is her crazy social status, or that feminine, barbie ego that has attracted countless famous men to Hollywood star Paris Hilton, we may never know. Nonetheless, this pink clad woman of many talents has definitely had her manicured handful of hunky men at her side over the years. At just 28, Paris had already been engaged twice- once to mouth-watering model Jason Shaw and then Greek shipping heir Paris Latsis. However, that’s just the top of the list for this A-list serial dater.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>Celeb Couples That Are The Ultimate Relationship Nightmare</a></strong></p><p>Nick Carter also stood by Hiltons side at one stage, along with the likes of Benji Madden, Stavros Niarchos,&nbsp; Rick Salomon, Andy Riddock and Adrian Grenier! Now that’s a list of handsome men. Now it’s current fiancé, Doug Reinhardt’s turn to try and tame the wild blonde.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-aniston>Jennifer Aniston</h2><p>Jennifer Aniston’s most epic love story has always been with Brad Pitt- once, back when they were the couples name on everyone’s lips and now, with rumours spiralling of them giving it another go. However, Pitt isn’t the only one that has tried his luck with the A-list star. Before Brad Pitt, Aniston had fiery romances with Adam Duritz and actor Tate Donovan before falling in love once again.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston's Failed Marriage Was A Hoax</a></strong></p><p>After the power couple split and Pitt fell for Angelina Jolie, Jennifer Aniston moved on with a string of relationships, all of which never really cut it for her. From Vince Vaughn and John Mayer, to Bradley Cooper and Gerard Butler. One thing for sure is that this celeb has a thing for successful, Hollywood hunks and we are so for it!</p><h2 id=bradley-cooper>Bradley Cooper</h2><p>The tabloids aren’t the only ones who consider Hollywood hunk Bradley Cooper to be the sexiest man alive. Some of the most beautiful women in the celebrity world have had their own slice of Cooper pie, all of which having sizzling, yet short lived flings with the popular actor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From a love affair with A-lister Jennifer Aniston, to the beloved, curvaceous Jennifer Lopez, Bradley Cooper has a taste for the gorgeous stars for sure. The celebrity has also been linked to blonde bombshell Cameron Diaz- along with Renee Zellweger and Olivia Wilde. Alas, it doesn’t end there. A few years ago Cooper wedded star Jennifer Esposito, however the love affair didn’t last. They split and now the heartbreaker is now giving love a go once again with Suki Waterhouse.</p><h2 id=drew-barrymore>Drew Barrymore</h2><p>When Drew Barrymore plays the awkward, hopeless romantic as a character in a chick flick, it’s considered cute and quirky. However, bring those little crazy tid-bits into the real world and this actress is just a little bit too boy crazy. In the entertainment scene, Barrymore is a legend- actress, director, producer and classic girl next door. Yet, step back into reality and the adorable red-head is a 34 year old romance fanatic who has been married and divorced twice, once to Tom Green and the other to some random bartender.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of that, our Drew has also tried her luck with Fabrizio Moretti of The Strokes, Justin Long and Luke Wilson. Nonetheless, our crazy, little firecracker can’t seem to make them stay! Could it be her impressive work-load, or does Drew Barrymore have a tendency to go a bit too loopy in the dating department?</p><h2 id=john-mayer>John Mayer</h2><p>If anything, Mayer holds the record for most spoken name on celeb women’s lips- making his way into most entrances on the list, this A-lister is far from conservative with his pick of lovers over the years. When most people think of epic celebrity lovers and ultimate Hollywood relationships, John Mayer’s fairy-tale love with Jennifer Aniston is always one that comes to mind. However, this heartthrob has had many, many more love stories than that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The puppy-eyed, tall, dark and handsome star has managed to&nbsp;shack&nbsp;up with some pretty big stars on the scene over the years and here are just some of those lucky ladies: Jennifer Love Hewitt, Jessica Simpson, Minka Kelly and Cameron Diaz. But that’s just the top of the list! Looks like our gorgeous man has a type, sweet, successful and stunning.</p><h2 id=george-clooney>George Clooney</h2><p>Although it may be a rarity to see silver-fox, man of our dreams George Clooney being linked to any wild stories in the tabloids lately, that doesn’t mean that this guy doesn’t have his fair share of love affairs and short-lived fairy tales. Like a finely aged wine, Clooney is a classic example of a specimen getting even better with age. At a handsome age of 52, you can bet that this A-lister has dated more gorgeous women than probably any other celeb in the business- despite being married for 5 years to actress Talia Balsam.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Clooney has had his hands on beautiful women such as Celine Balitran and Krista Allen. He has shared sheets with Lisa Snowden, Charlize Theron and Renee Zellweger and has even had some romantic time in the sun with the beautiful Lucy Lui. However, as expected, this is just the beginning of the handsome&nbsp;man's list. Elisabetta Canalis and Sarah Larson have also been blessed with some time with George Clooney, along with most current fling Stacy Keibler who was lucky enough to tame Mister Clooney for two whole years!</p><h2 id=kate-hudson>Kate Hudson</h2><p>Actress, Kate Hudson, comes across as the type of girl any guy would want. She’s thin, blonde, has a million dollar grin and can kick it with the boys. She’s got that relaxed beauty about her, which you would think is exactly what men look for in a girl. Now, don’t get the wrong idea- Hudson attracts men everywhere she goes and for good reason. Men are falling for this girl left, right and centre. Yet, the problem may just be that the gorgeous celebrity simply can’t choose which one she wants to settle down with!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At just 21, the actress married Black Crowes frontman, Chris Robinson. However, after the couple divorced 6 years later, Hudson has gone quite the wild ride, bumping with several of Hollywoods bachelors; Owen Wilson, Dax Shepard, Lance Armstrong and her most recent lover, Yankees sportsman Alex Rodriguez.</p><h2 id=gerard-butler>Gerard Butler</h2><p>Gerard Butler is one of those rare actors who’s personas played in movies are actually pretty accurate to their every day lives. In this case, Gerard Butler definitely lives up to the heartthrob/man of our dreams kid of guy he plays so well. Of course he would, considering the long, impressive list of gorgeous women Butler has won the hearts of, though not so long lived. The famous actor has a spot for celebrities and models- and for good reason.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From (you guessed it) Jennifer Aniston, to the gorgeous French TV star Laurie Chlewa, Butler dipped his toe in the beautiful celebrity pool before finding the glorious world of models. He has dated Serbian model Martina Rajic, moved on to current arm-candy and Italian star model Madalina Ghenea and has also been linked in the past with the stunning Brandi Glanville.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift>Taylor Swift</h2><p>It just wouldn’t be right to have a list of serial daters and not have Taylor Swift join in on the fun. Her love affairs are, after all, the inspiration to most breakup songs across the world. Sit down, relax and enjoy the wild ride that is Taylor Swift's short-lived romances that broke hearts and inspired some of her best work throughout her career.</p><p>Beginning with (you guessed it) John Mayer, then sliding through to world-renowned loverboy Harry Styles, Jake Gyllenhaal and Calvin Harris. We are just getting started and already, we can see that Swift has an eye for pretty boys. Taylor Lautner, Joe Jonas, Cory Monteith, Patrick Schwarzenegger are also in the mix and it is both enviable to have held such gorgeous bods and impressive that the star has made her way through such an extensive list. Although Taylor Swift is currently riding the wave as a single gal, we can’t forget her most recent epic romance with big-shot Tom Hiddleston either.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=#>Perfect Celeb Couples Who Are Hiding Something</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nYWp6pLHLnpmroaSesrR51qGmZpuRo8FutM6lm2aqlaGutbXOp6qhoaCofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
