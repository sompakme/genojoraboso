Makes perfect sense now,” they wrote, referring to her getting the drugs from the <a href=#>Caresha, Please</a> host. She took to X, <a href=#>formerly known as Twitter</a>, to quickly shut that narrative down.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“First of all I was in the half way house being drug tested EVERY night I went in!” she wrote. “I explained this YEARS ago I NEVER did cocaine & never will it actually destroyed my family!

He originally spoke about Diddy using “pink cocaine,” otherwise known as “tusi” but the updated version claimed that Yung Miami, Puff’s partner, was helping him to transport it.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Plaintiff and the Combs Rico Enterprise were rehearsing for ‘Something in the Westival’ in Virginia,” the court documents read. “Plaintiff Jones personally witnessed Mr. Combs do a few lines of coke in his dressing room. Defendant Sean Combs wanted tuci but [Brendan Paul] forgot it, so Defendant Kristina Khorram called Yung Miami. Who then brought it on the private jet from Miami.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The coincidence is interesting given the fact people were aware of the mogul and “Act Up” rapper’s relationship, and as the lawsuits came out, they continually wondered if she took part in any of Diddy’s many alleged crimes. As recently as this past Monday, one fan asked “Where Caresha at?” She replied, “Right here what’s up?”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">This snowball continues to roll down the hill and pick up more people along the way. This week got off to a crazy start as Diddy’s Los Angeles and Miami homes were <a href=#>raided</a> on Monday. While the Bad Boy founder wasn’t in either residence, his sons Christian Combs and Justin Combs were found at his LA home. Homeland Security expert Hal Kempfer told <a rel=nofollow href=#>Fox 11</a> that they were searching “laptops, flash drives, and anything that would connect Combs with the allegations.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Puff’s legal team deemed the “<a href=#>military-level force</a>” used to raid their client’s home as “excessive” and reiterated his innocence. “There is no excuse for the excessive show of force and hostility exhibited by authorities or the way his children and employees were treated,” Aaron Dyer, his attorney, said.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The former Making The Band star was found near an airport in Miami that same day and his private jet was <a href=#>tracked to Antigua</a>. This story began in November 2023 when his ex-girlfriend <a href=#>Cassie filed a lawsuit </a>for rape, sex trafficking, and other heinous crimes. Though they settled outside of court, it was the catalyst for several other sexual assault lawsuits to be thrown the former REVOLT owner’s way.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5%2FBbrDRrp5mraOaerrBzaBkpqGRorZuwNGanZ%2Bhk6C2r7OMnKacmZmjsm6wyJ2bsmVhZ4B1hJVtb3FwXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
