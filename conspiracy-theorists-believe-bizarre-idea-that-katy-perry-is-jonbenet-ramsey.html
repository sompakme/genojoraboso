In a recently resurfaced YouTube video from December 2014, the faceless voice of Dave Johnson proclaims that the bizarre 1996 Ramsey murder case was all a hoax that Perry, 31, has kept under wraps in her rise to fame."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That sacrifice was in name only, and that was to get something, and that something was to become a star. JonBenet became Katy Perry, and that’s a fact.”</span></p><p>The YouTube user then reveals several facts that bolster his claim, including the fact that JonBenet’s parents, <b>John</b> and Patsy, look remarkably similar to Perry’s own parents, pastors<b> Keith Hudson</b> and <b>Mary Perry</b>. (Patsy died in June 2006 of ovarian cancer; John has since remarried, tying the knot with fashion designer <b>Jan Rousseaux</b> in 2011.)</p><p>https://youtube.com/watch?v=FPpH-_k3PQU</p><p><span>“He shaved his head. She lost some weight,” Johnson quips, superimposing images of both sets of parents onto each other to prove his point.</span></p><p>Another theorist with the YouTube username Jungle Surfer also pointed to the fact that Perry and JonBenet look alike, right down to their similar eyebrows.</p><p>“You know, the eyebrows don’t change much on a person,” he intones over his own video backing up Johnson’s claims. “You’re born with your eyebrows. They’re very close, very close indeed, aren’t they? … As you know, this whole entertainment industry is just a charade — you really don’t know the truth.”</p><p>The mystery surrounding JonBenet’s murder is still to this day one of the most confounding mysteries. Though her parents, and even her older brother, <b>Burke</b>, were all named as suspects in the case, their involvement in the little girl’s murder was cleared partially in 2003, and then finally in July 2008.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaiq12grrXFjKmcq6qpYq6kwNSao6WxXZ%2B8r67Ep5ytZaKWurSx2GaaqKajpbazrcKyZK2glaS%2Fqr%2FTrGSsnZWierW7jK2foqabYsCwedZqbW5rZ2V8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
