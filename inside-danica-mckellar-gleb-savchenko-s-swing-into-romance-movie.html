He joined the reality series as a pro in 2013 for season 16 and <a href=#>has since competed on nine more seasons</a>.</p><p>The Great American Family project was filmed prior to <a href=#>the SAG-AFTRA strike</a>, which began in July. The picketing is still ongoing as the Screen Actors Guild union members fight against the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) for better streaming residuals among other labor issues. (SAG members are forbidden from promoting struck work or starting new projects, <a href=#>with a few exceptions</a>, as the strike persists.)</p><p>“We would alternate between dance rehearsals and acting rehearsals over the weekends. He was like a sponge with everything I taught him and did a terrific job playing my ex-fiancé and ex-dance partner — you’d never know it was his first acting job,” <a href=#>McKellar wrote</a> of her time on set with Savchenko. “And dancing with him is some of the most fun I have ever had on a movie set!”</p><p>McKellar revealed that she and Savchenko referred to their filming location in Canada as “Art Camp,” which is evident by the chemistry the two have on the dance floor in rehearsals.</p><p>“It was Acting Camp for Gleb and Dance Camp for me and <strong>David [Haydn-Jones]</strong>,” she added. “A treasured time for sure!”</p><p>In the movie, <a href=#>McKellar plays Christine Sims</a>, who discovers her family’s General Store is in trouble after returning to her hometown for the annual Fall Festival. Savchenko portrays Christine’s ex-fiancé, whom she must reunite with to help keep her family’s legacy alive. Hadyn-Jones, 45, enters the picture as Christine’s new love interest.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Watch the exclusive video above to see how well McKellar and Savchenko connected in the dance studio — and catch the full film next month as part of Great American Family’s Great American Autumn lineup.</p><p>Swing Into Romance premieres on <a href=#>Great American Family</a> Saturday, October 7, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKCnq5mZsm6wwKegnJldorCssculmKtll6Gyo3nSmq2coJWjuLC%2FjKyuoqaXYravwM5mqailkaOwpnnMqK2inV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
