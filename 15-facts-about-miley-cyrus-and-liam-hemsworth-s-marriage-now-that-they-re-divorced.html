It was a case of instant passion for Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth, and the two weren’t shy about canoodling in public whenever they had the chance to. This young love really blossomed, and the two eventually got engaged, before calling the engagement off in 2013.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then in 2016, one of them asked to borrow a Halloween costume from the other, and the two rekindled their romance. Soon enough, Cyrus was photographed wearing her engagement ring again. When asked what was going on between the two of them, Cyrus was quick to say that people would figure it out.</p><p>After nearly a decade of on-and-off dating, the pair married. They chose a secret ceremony to ring in 2019. By summertime, they were separated. By the beginning of 2020, their divorce was finalized, with both parties signing on the dotted line. This process was accelerated thanks to a prenuptial agreement.</p><p>The two had a rollercoaster relationship that many people in their teens and twenties (and maybe even people in their thirties or forties) can relate to. Things didn’t work out and their relationship was very complicated, but no one could doubt how much the pair loved each other at one time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it’s unlikely they’ll ever reconnect, it isn’t impossible. Here are 15 facts about Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth's marriage, now that they’re divorced.</p><h2 id=not-a-press-shy-couple><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Not A Press Shy Couple</span></h2><p>When two famous people are dating, the press loves it, because fans of either celeb (or both) pay attention. Liam and Miley were known to pose for photos on the red carpet; they didn’t avoid the paparazzi! They went to very public places together, so the Internet was routinely filled with photos of their lives together.</p><h2 id=about-the-ring><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>About The Ring</span></h2><p>In 2012, Liam and Miley confirmed their first engagement. An interview with People Magazine made it official, and details of a May 31st proposal (and a 3.5-carat Neil Lane diamond ring) hit the newsstands. Miley said, “I’m so happy to be engaged and look forward to a life of happiness with Liam.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=teen-engagement><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Teen Engagement</span></h2><p>After a tumultuous phase following their first engagement, which was characterized by several public and private breakups Miley finally spoke up about officially ending their engagement. Of course, this was before they got back together a few years later, in 2016.</p><p>Miley said, “I don’t think I realized what 19 truly is, and I got engaged at 19, and I definitely wouldn’t change being engaged. It was so fun wearing a fat rock for a few years, but now, I just feel like I can actually be happy.”</p><h2 id=nicknames><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Nicknames</span></h2><p>Anyone who followed either celeb’s Instagram account knows how much they posted about each other, and that Liam would often refer to Miley as ‘my angel’. Unfortunately, we can’t go back and look at any of their past posts.</p><p>Since they separated, Miley scrubbed her account of all photographic “evidence” of their relationship and the two stopped following each other (like many of us do with our exes, post-breakup).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=their-home-destroyed-by-wildfires><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Their Home Destroyed By Wildfires</span></h2><p>When their Malibu home was destroyed by the California wildfires, it put things in perspective for the couple, bringing them closer together than ever. Some say the loss of their home was what inspired them to finally set a date for their wedding. They must have felt like their relationship was more important than all the ‘stuff’ in their home.</p><h2 id=hard-partying-ways><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Hard Partying Ways</span></h2><p>Many noted that, during their break-up in the 20-teens, Liam adopted a rescue animal while Miley continued to party hard. When speaking up about the breakup on social media, Cyrus said: “Liam and I have been together for a decade. I’ve said it before & it remains true; I love Liam and always will.”</p><p>She added, ”I had to make a healthy decision for myself to leave a previous life behind. I am the healthiest and happiest I have been in a long time. You can say I am a twerking, pot smoking, foul mouthed hillbilly but I am not a liar. I am proud to say, I am simply in a different place from where I was when I was younger.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-low-key-secret-wedding-hits-the-press><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>The Low Key Secret Wedding Hits The Press</span></h2><p>While their New Year’s Eve wedding in Nashville was supposed to stay out of the press, that didn’t happen. Apparently, many guests were reminded to not post photos of the big occasion, but one attendee (one of Liam’s surfing buddies) didn’t get the warning.</p><p>It was an innocent mistake when the surfing buddy posted a photo of the nuptials online, but just the same, it tipped a lot of people off that the two had tied the knot.</p><h2 id=what-liam-found-out-online><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>What Liam Found Out Online</span></h2><p>Rumor has it that the statement released surrounding the couple’s divorce hit the tabloids before Liam was notified. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a> reported that the statement reading, "Liam and Miley have agreed to separate at this time”, was released when Liam was in Australia, so many fans and family would have received the news before he did.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-cheating-rumors><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>The Cheating Rumors</span></h2><p>The near decade-long relationship was fraught with rumors of infidelity, particularly from Cyrus. Miley has said, "My relationship is unique. And I don’t know that I would ever publicly allow people in there because it’s so complex, and modern, and new that I don’t think we’re in a place where people would get it."</p><p>In terms of the end of their relationship Cyrus did speak up about the cheating rumors on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>, saying: “I can admit to a lot of things but I refuse to admit that my marriage ended because of cheating. I can accept that the life I’ve chosen means I must live completely open and transparent with my fans who I love, and the public, 100% of the time. What I cannot accept is being told I’m lying to cover up a crime I haven’t committed. I have nothing to hide.”</p><h2 id=the-truth-behind-wrecking-ball><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>The Truth Behind Wrecking Ball</span></h2><p>Since Miley and Liam were so different, it’s no secret that they had to work hard to stay together. Unfortunately, despite their hard work, they couldn’t have their happily ever after.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Miley’s hit, Wrecking Ball, is said to be about their tumultuous on-and-off relationship, and it was released long before they got married.</p><h2 id=conflicting-schedules><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Conflicting Schedules</span></h2><p>When one person has a family based on the other side of the world and both people in a relationship have intense work commitments, balance can be hard. Everyone knows that long-distance relationships are tough, and the one between Cyrus and Hemsworth was no different.</p><p>Sure, they had money to fly wherever and whenever they wanted, but absence doesn’t always make the heart grow fonder.</p><h2 id=pansexuality-entering-the-marriage><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Pansexuality Entering The Marriage</span></h2><p>Throughout their relationship, there were public admissions of Miley’s pansexuality and whispers that she could never remain faithful to anyone, Liam included.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Revelist </a>speculated about the timing of the ‘surprise’ divorce announcement: “Our theory: Cyrus knew those photos of her and Kaitlynn Carter making out were going to be published, and pre-emptively dumped her man.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=their-home><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Their Home</span></h2><p>When the wildfires hit their Malibu home, Liam was a champion in terms of getting Miley and all of their shared animals out quickly and safely. Cyrus told Howard Stern on his show, "He was so incredible. He got all the animals out in his truck. He put two pigs in crates, which I tell you is so hard. He got a lot of action for saving the animals. We had to make sure he knew I was very, very grateful."</p><p>The couple also used their shared wealth to donate 500K to wildfire relief. Thankfully, they still had their Nashville home (where they hosted their wedding).</p><h2 id=coparenting-the-fur-babies><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Coparenting The Fur Babies</span></h2><p>Miley and Liam had a lot of pets together. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ&nbsp;</a> reported that “Miley will keep her menagerie of pets -- 7 dogs, 2 horses, 2 mini horses, 3 cats and a pig” and added, “If Liam wanted to put up a fight, he could in California because there's a new law that allows judges to determine which party is best suited to keep the pets.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We’re guessing that Liam will reach out and rescue other animals, post-divorce.</p><h2 id=was-the-wedding-a-factor-in-the-split><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Was The Wedding A Factor In The Split?</span></h2><p>Many have speculated that the wedding was a last-ditch effort to try to make their relationship work. Ending things for good after just eight months of marriage seems to reveal that cracks were showing before they filed the divorce papers.</p><p>A source close to the pair said, “Liam and Miley love each other a lot, but they’re incredibly different people and at times have struggled to make things work. They had problems for years, a lot of secret break-ups – but everyone thought that the wedding would make things right.”</p><p>Sources: Rolling Stone, Showbiz Cheat Sheet, The Sun, The Wrap, Glamour, Mirror, Fox News</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miley Cyrus Wasn't Invited To The Grammys & The Reason May Surprise You</a></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhobmWWlrC1v4yamaitpGK6qrjEsmScsaKqwG6tzZ1kpaGRonqpscysrqiqpJ3AbrnAq6mimZeaeq%2B71maroZmkYsGpsdirnGacmau8s6%2FEnWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
