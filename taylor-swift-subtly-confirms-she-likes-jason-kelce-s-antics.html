Jason, however, countered her warning, arguing, “Kylie the first time I met you I was black-out drunk and fell asleep at the bar, this is part of the charm. … This is <a href=#>my best first impression</a> and this is my best chance.”</p><p>Sunday’s game marked the first time Jason and Kylie met Swift since the singer began dating Travis in summer 2023. While Swift has been spotted supporting Travis and Chiefs games all over the country — often alongside Travis’ parents,<strong> Donna</strong> and <strong>Ed Kelce</strong> — Jason and Kylie have been busy due to Jason’s own NFL season with the Philadelphia Eagles. (The Eagles’ 2023-2024 season came to an end on January 15 when they lost to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Jason-Kelce-Wanted-to-Take-His-Shirt-Off-Way-Earlier-at-Bills-Game.jpg><p>When the Chiefs and the Eagles had their post-Super Bowl LVII showdown in November 2023, Swift was unable to attend due to a rescheduled Eras Tour concert in Brazil.</p><p>The wait was seemingly worth it, as Travis said during Thursday’s podcast that Swift was a big fan of Jason, telling his brother, “Tay <a href=#>absolutely loved</a> you.”</p><p>Sure enough, footage found via social media from Sunday’s game showed Swift and Jason <a href=#>high-fiving</a> while they watched the Chiefs defeat the Bills 27-24. Jason also spotted a young fan of Swift’s in the crowd during the game and brought her over to the Grammy winner for a quick hello.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We’re gonna show this to Taylor,” Jason could be seen saying in footage shared via social media, bringing the fan over to the suite window<a href=#> to wave to Swift</a>, who was seen returning the gesture.</p><p>As for Kylie’s reaction to her husband’s hilarious shenanigans, Kylie commented on the “New Heights” Instagram on Wednesday to reveal that she plans on<a href=#> using the incident</a> as leverage.</p><p>“‘I’m not asking for permission, I’m doing this.’ – the exact quote I will say when I’m grabbing the keys to go get a cat,” she wrote</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatmamhvLN50rCgn6xdqMKjwMuyZJynnpu2s7nSZqqhnV2htqyx0mahmqufo3qsscucnKxlkaPBqq%2FSaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
