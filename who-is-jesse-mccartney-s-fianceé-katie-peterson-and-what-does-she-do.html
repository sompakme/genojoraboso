Jesse reportedly proposed to his leading lady at a fancy restaurant during their date night.</p><p>They even received a tableside visit from Chef Wolfgang Puck himself, said&nbsp;People's source, marking an already momentous occasion.</p><p>What fans really want to know (other than all the details about the ring, of course) is who Katie Peterson is, and what she does. Is she fine with all the paparazzi chasing her man because she's a high-profile celeb too? Or is the soon-to-be Mrs. McCartney a relative unknown?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though Peterson is no stranger to stepping out for glam events with her future hubby, she's not quite as high-profile as he is. However, that doesn't mean Jesse's&nbsp;fianceé doesn't have a job or her own interests.</p><p>In fact, she runs a lifestyle blog (and has since before it was Instagram-cool), where she shares recipes, her tour bus diary (obvs she attends her hubby's concerts and events), and more. Aptly titled "The Rebel Blonde," Peterson's blog seems to have gone on a hiatus, but only because she's busy prepping to become Mrs. McCartney.</p><p>Well, that, and she's busy being an Instagram influencer, apparently! Like other famous faces (or wives of famous faces), Katie posts up on IG with everything from her pup to workout gear to delivery meals.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like other content creators, it's clear Katie has joined the sponsorship bandwagon, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. Though she's supportive of Jesse's music (duh), she does have her own business to tend to, and contracts to fulfill.</p><p>But that's not Katie's&nbsp;only work history. She's also spent time modeling, says&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Distractify</a>, and has appeared in a few films, too. She also appeared on Disney's rival network in a 2013 episode of&nbsp;Victorious.</p><p>The pair didn't meet in Hollywood, though; Jesse has revealed that the couple met in a bar. At the time, Peterson was a bartender, McCartney revealed, so Katie's career goes back even further than her modeling era.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Who knows what she'll do next, or whether it'll involve more YouTube videos with her soon-to-be hubby...</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Lesser Known Facts About Jesse McCartney</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqujmnqur8Kaqa2mla56p7XAp5qenV2grrW1xGannqyVp8Cwuoywn5qsXZm8pr%2BMrJ%2BeZZSkfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
