According to Dash, he’s been “losing money for years” and is admittedly not as financially stable as he was in his heyday, when he was raking in millions of dollars annually.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“While I’m investing in something else, I might not be making the money and the profit, so I can’t afford to pay out what I was when I was having EBITA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, and Amortization) of eight million dollars a year,” the 52-year-old told Moreno. “So you can’t judge how much I’m gonna pay out by how much I made 20 years ago.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1380980283-1.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Dash continued by admitting that he’s currently “broke” due to investments in his current businesses and hasn’t yielded enough profits to cover hundreds of thousands in child support at this time based on his income. “I’ve had to start [a] new company from scratch, without any money to start it with,” he added.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I had to do it [by] rubbing two sticks together. So I&nbsp;can’t&nbsp;pay out three or four hundred thousand a year in child support, ‘cause I ain’t making that. But I’m not ashamed of that because I have things to show for it, but it hasn’t profited yet. I’m like a proud broke, but it ain’t broke, because I have things to show for it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-961640576-1.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The enterprising mogul contends that his ex-wife should “pay the bills” in her home due to having received a chunk of his fortune as part of their divorce in 2009. “So I have to now start a new company, without any working capital,” he continued. “So I had to flip. So while I’m doing that, it’s like, yo, [Rachel] <a href=#>got the money I was making </a>— [she should] pay the bills. But you can’t be mad at me and make me feel bad if the money that I had to give the kids, you got, and you still expecting me to pay that while I’m investing and losing money for years.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Damon Dash’s legal battles involving child support have been well-documented. In 2019, he was arrested for owing more than $400,000 in child support to Roy and another woman, Cindy Morales, but was released after paying more than $1 million in total to clear his debts.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Watch Damon Dash’s The CEO Show below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5murrGMnZisoF2hvLS1zaBkpqeemsZuxcSaqaxloKe8trCMm6moo5VifnN%2Fk3Fnbmpla3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
