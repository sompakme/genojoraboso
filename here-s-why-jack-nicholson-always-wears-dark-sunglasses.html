He's been keeping the habit up for his entire career, too.</p><p>As the spec site&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">All About Eyes</a> points out, Nicholson even wore his sunglasses while presenting an Oscar years ago. Of course,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jack's worth millions today</a>, so really, who's to tell him what he can and can't do?</p><p>But fans are curious as to why Jack wears his glasses&nbsp;all the time. Does he have a medical condition? Is he trying to hide something? Or does he just really like the accessories&nbsp;that much?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jack Nicholson Made $50 Million As The Joker. Here’s How He Did It</a></span></p><p>Jack knows fans wonder about his glasses, and he doesn't mind the speculation. He does have sort of an explanation, though: his dark shades are a branding decision.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Esquire</a> noted, Jack even said of his signature style, years ago; "With my sunglasses on, I'm Jack Nicholson. Without them, I'm fat and 60." That's debatable, but it&nbsp;is true that Jack's more recognizable with his trademark shades.</p><p>The thing is, he's not really wearing them for any particular reason, at least, not as far as fans can tell. And of course, his collection, which appears to include everything from Ray-Bans to Persol and Serengeti spectacles, is fairly fashionable.</p><p>Jack's even been known to sport different colored lenses, instead of the standard polarized selections of celebs who are aiming to hide themselves away. Nicholson's specs are often orange- or red-hued, and it's not hard to pick him out of a crowd due to the vibrant color.</p><p>He wears his glasses indoors, outdoors, and on vacation, and he must have hundreds of pairs by now. And to fans' relief, it's all about fashion and keeping up appearances.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jack Nicholson Was Hannibal Lecter, Almost</a></span></p><p>In contrast, other stars are dealing with eye conditions that make it tough to stand the flash of paparazzi cameras or bright stage lights. That's not to say Jack isn't donning his sunglasses for similar reasons, though; paparazzi still chase the seasoned actor and he can't even enjoy a meal out without someone snapping his pic.</p><p>In all honesty, most celebrities probably wear sunglasses to block out the glare of both fan and paparazzi flashes. And at Jack's age, he probably doesn't plan on changing his habits anytime soon.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Most People Forgot These Facts About Jack Nicholson</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdn66kt4ynoJygn6HAsLqMsJyaqqNisaK%2BymaqrqaXoa60v8SsZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
