His producing credits include W., District 9, Fury, Bad Moms, Dirty Grandpa, Halloween, and Halloween Kills Bill Block has found a new place to hang his hat, having picked up a Spanish-style gem in the steep hills directly above L.A.’s bustling Sunset Strip. On and off the market since earlier this year, once for as much as $9 million, the home’s listing price was reduced twice before going to the Miramax CEO at a substantial $2.4 million discount.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED:</b><a href=#><b>This Is The Most Expensive Jewelry Kim Kardashian Has Ever Worn</b></a></span></p><p>Property records show that the seller was film and TV director Joseph McGinty Nichol, known professionally as McG, who purchased the place from boutique hotelier Brad Korzen for $5.8 million 14 years ago, back in October 2008. Accessorized during Korzen’s tenure by his wife Kelly Wearstler, the premises still include many of the celebrity decorator’s signature design elements, per the listing.</p><p>Hidden away behind walls and gates, at the end of a secluded dead-end street, the striking brick and terracotta-roof structure is nestled on over a quarter-acre parcel of land offering picturesque ocean and city lights views. Built in 1933 and extensively renovated since then, the two-story residence features three bedrooms and four baths filtered throughout 3,235 square feet of “highly character-infused” living space rife with period details and modern amenities. A one-bedroom, one-bath guesthouse with a private entrance has its own living room and kitchen, per <a href=#><i>Dirt</i></a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A grassy central courtyard holds a fountain and sundeck-encased pool, with the front door opening into an entry foyer adorned with dark hardwood floors and a windowed brick accent wall. Other highlights include a living room resting beneath a vaulted wood-beam ceiling and displaying a massive wood-burning fireplace and wall of wood-trimmed windows overlooking the eye-catching vistas. The formal dining room leads out to a patio, and a spacious galley-style kitchen is outfitted with stainless appliances and cabinetry, along with a breakfast area.</p><p>There’s also a family/media room, as well as an upstairs master retreat boasting a separate seating area that spills out to a private patio, two walk-in closets, and a spa-inspired bath equipped with dual vanities and a wet room containing a soaking tub and shower. In addition to the aforementioned pool, the grounds also host a couple of fire-pits and a spa, plus a wealth of brick verandas ideal for al fresco lounging and entertaining. A two-car garage can be found out front.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT:</b><a href=#><b>MDLBeast Soundstorm 2022: Biggest Comeback Of All Time, Five Rap Legends Light Up The Big Beast Stage With DJ Khaled</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Dirt</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaboZyheqO4zpyiZpqlrsBuv9Snqp6sXajBs7XPZpqopaCkwq%2BwjLCgraBdn7K1uMinnKtlpp6yuL%2BMnqqtmaSaeqe70WZtZm5doratuMiopWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
