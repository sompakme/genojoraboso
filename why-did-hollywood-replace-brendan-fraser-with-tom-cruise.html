But why?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-tom-cruise-replace-brendan-fraser>Why Did Tom Cruise Replace Brendan Fraser?</h2><p>Fans <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">have a few ideas</a> on why Tom Cruise replaced Brendan Fraser for the attempt at reviving mummies once and for all. For one thing, Tom Cruise is recognized worldwide, which, the studio probably assumed, would draw massive audiences into the box office.</p><p>Plus, the plan was to launch a new franchise on the same old central theme. Being that Tom was already a 'Mission Impossible' action star, it made sense that the producers wanted to go with him to breathe life into the mummy concept.</p><p>Fans suggested that the studio wanted to "make a splash" with Tom, and also move to a "grittier" and "darker" tone. As one fan commented, the original 'Mummy' movies weren't that at all. Instead, they were "goofy, fairly colorful," and just plain&nbsp;funny sometimes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-didn-t-tom-cruise-appear-in-more-mummy-films>Why Didn't Tom Cruise Appear In More 'Mummy' Films?</h2><p>Unfortunately for the cast and crew of 'The Mummy' movies, the entire thing fizzled out after nearly two decades of effort.</p><p>Sure, fans watched the ratings sink&nbsp;for each of Brendan Fraser's 'The Mummy' films (there were three). But then, Tom Cruise's version tanked the worst, ending the film industry's efforts at reprising the original intrigue of 'The Mummy' a final time.</p><p>It was a solid effort, but fans can't help but wonder whether enlisting the help of Fraser for the reboot would've made it a hit. Or, at least, keep it from ranking so low on the box office charts.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="15 Precise Moments The Mummy Franchise Started To Suck" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Precise Moments The Mummy Franchise Started To Suck</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbaledOopGaboqq2tLGMq5yppJGYsm6u0Z6lnZmeYrOzrdKeqWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
