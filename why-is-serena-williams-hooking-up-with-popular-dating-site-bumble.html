Serena Ventures and the Bumble Fund share a lot of overlapping goals, which is why their partnership was a no-brainer. The Women of Courage profile and initiative are part of their shared goals in promoting the empowerment of women in entrepreneurship and business.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Why Serena Williams & These Other Celebs Went Vegan</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdnsBuv8SrnKeZXay2rbjImqSsZZikvKy1zaBkrqhdrLa1tIyppqmtnJa%2FbrDAraCnn12otrWxjJusppqcmnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
