Kelly on the other hand is a Sagittarius, with her birthday falling on the 14th of December. According to astrologers, a Taurus and Sagittarius are <a href=#>quite incompatible</a> but have chances of a stable and happy marriage once they understand and accept each other's differences. With three years of marriage down the road, it seems like astrologers got the couple’s horoscope right.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-was-a-professional-basketballer><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>He Was A Professional Basketballer</span></h2><p>André Murillo might not be one a <a href=#>big NBA star,</a> but he is successful in his own right.

Murillo would later move to Rostock where he played the power forward position for the Rostock Seawolves. With his exceptional playing skills, Murillo has garnered several awards and recognitions including the NAIA All-American Honorable Mention.</p><h2 id=his-basketball-career-kicked-off-in-high-school><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>His Basketball Career Kicked Off In High School</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Murillo began playing basketball in high school when he attended El Toro High in Lake Forest, California.

Dave Holmquist, Murillo’s basketball coach at university, was also reportedly instrumental to the basketballer’s healing journey.</p><h2 id=has-a-net-worth-of-over-800k><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Has A Net Worth Of Over $800k</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It looks like love doesn't care about how much you have in your pocket as long as you're acting right! The handsome basketballer and husband has a net worth of over $800,000. Although his net worth is only about a quarter of Tori’s, who has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an estimated net worth of $3 million</a>, the couple looks happy, and keep growing stronger regardless</p><h2 id=he-is-a-devout-christian><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>He Is A Devout Christian</span></h2><p>André Murillo is a Christian, and he is faith-driven. The basketball player majored in biblical studies and has been big on his beliefs ever since. It is therefore only fitting that his marriage to Tori fully reflects the couple’s beliefs.

In addition to Tori, André also seemingly adores his sister Michelle Murillo, his nieces, and his nephews.</p><p>The basketballer’s Instagram is splattered with pictures of his nephews and nieces and while he and Tori are yet to welcome kids of their own, it is quite evident that Murillo will make an amazing father. The couple has a dog, Froddo, whom they completely adore, and who knows, we could have a mini Tori and André soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=murillo-is-very-supportive-of-his-wife><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Murillo Is Very Supportive Of His Wife</span></h2><p>Speaking during a 2019 interview, Tori explained how supportive her husband is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">saying</a>, “The last tour, he was able to come out for that. It was just awesome. He just loves to help. He’s so hands-on. Wherever he is needed he will be there. It’s just really awesome to have him.” The proud husband also supports his wife’s career and regularly promotes her music on his social media.</p><h2 id=he-is-more-outgoing-than-tori><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>He Is More Outgoing Than Tori</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tori might be the star of the family, but Murillo is apparently the more outgoing one of the couple.
