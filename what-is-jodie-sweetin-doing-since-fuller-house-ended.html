The show's popularity lasted eight seasons with the show going out on top when it ended in May 1995. Its end left older cast members to wonder where their next project was going to come from and younger ones to try to navigate a new normal without their TV family surrounding them every day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While some in the Tanner family landed on their feet without problem, Sweetin struggled in the years after the show she spent her formative years on, ended. Between overcoming substance issues as well as three failed marriages, it was a rough road for the actress. So it was perfect timing for a re-emergence on the small screen when talks for Fuller House began.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jodie Sweetin's Life And Net Worth After 'Full House' Explained</a></span></p><p>There was no hesitation for Sweetin when it came to reprising her role as the middle Tanner sister. And as a result of doing so, doors have opened for the mother of two that may never have been possible had the majority of the cast from Full House not agreed to reprise their well-known characters to make Fuller House the success it was from 2016 through 2020.</p><p>Here is what Jodie Sweetin has been doing since Fuller House ended.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jodie-sweetin-is-making-a-name-for-herself-with-christmas-movies>Jodie Sweetin Is Making A Name For Herself With Christmas Movies</h2><p>When looking for a steady paycheck in acting, many TV and film stars are turning to making season-specific small-screen movies. Specifically, Christmas movies, something that Sweetin has wholeheartedly embraced. And in turn, has made strides for audiences to see her outside of her Stephanie Tanner role.</p><p>Before leaving Fuller House, the UnSweetined author made her mark on the Hallmark Channel with her Christmas film repertoire. Since the series came to an end, she has not only starred in other Hallmark Christmas movies out this season but has one on Lifetime as well.</p><p>And while no longer starring opposite Candace Cameron Bure in Fuller House, there is a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">connection between the two actresses and Sweetin's Hallmark movie this holiday season</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>20 Pics Fuller House Producers Don't Want Us To See Of Jodie Sweetin</a></span></p><p>A Cozy Christmas Inn is a sequel to Christmas Under Wraps. A Hallmark film that Cameron Bure starred in, in 2014.</p><p>With the elder Tanner sister making her way to GAC, the role went to Sweetin, who picked up the storyline where it left off nearly a decade ago.</p><h2 id=competitive-reality-tv-came-calling-again>Competitive Reality TV Came Calling Again</h2><p>Dancing with the Stars fans will recall that Sweetin made her dancing debut on the show during Season 22 in 2016. And after catching the competitive reality tv bug, the Swipe Left star went on to compete in a few other reality shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wanting to challenge her ability to survive in the wild, <a href=#>Sweetin competed in the show </a><a href=#>Beyond The Edge</a>. Many thought it would be like a celebrity Survivor (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">something that it was not</a>).</p><p>Instead, Beyond The Edge paid the celebrities competing in the wilds of Panama for every day they stayed on the show. It was up to the celebrities to leave when they "reached their breaking point."</p><p>As such, all the money went to charity and there was no elimination. The show centered on celebrities seeing what they were physically capable of when doing physical challenges in sometimes inclement conditions.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jodie Sweetin's Relationships With The Four Men She Has Married Are Downright Fascinating<strong></strong></a></span></p><p>Sweetin also competed on Worst Cooks In America Celebrity Edition: That's So 90s. And while she was not crowned the winner of the competition, Sweetin did make it to the final round to compete against Tracey Gold.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sweetin proved that regardless of the challenge put before her, the Merry Swissmas star will give it her all to raise money for charities close to her heart.</p><h2 id=jodie-sweetin-got-married-since-fuller-house-ended>Jodie Sweetin Got Married Since Fuller House Ended</h2><p>Perhaps the most important thing to happen in Sweetin's personal life since Fuller House ended was that she got married. This was less than a year after being engaged but as a result of being together for years beforehand.</p><p>Sweetin and her long-distance boyfriend, Mescal Wasilewski <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">got married in July 2022 in a small ceremony on the beach in California</a>.</p><p>While the two were married just six months after becoming engaged, the happy couple had been together for close to five years before saying "I do."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And while the first part of the relationship was spent long distance with Wasilewski living in Brooklyn and Sweetin living in California, the long courtship worked for the duo. All the while it gave Sweetin's daughters, <a href=#>Zoie Herpin</a> and Beatrix Coyle time to build a relationship with the social worker.</p><p>This made for an easier transition for the blended family and caused as little disruption in the <a href=#>family life Sweetin created with her girls</a> before the wedding vows were said.</p><h2 id=tossing-around-ideas-for-a-fuller-house-reboot-with-a-twist>Tossing Around Ideas For A Fuller House Reboot With A Twist</h2><p>Though Fuller House ended just a few years ago, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweetin appears to want to take Stephanie Tanner into the golden years</a>. She has not shut the door on a Fuller House reboot just yet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Calling the reboot Fullest House, Sweetin can see a version of the show that is akin to that of Golden Girls. While such a series would be decades in the future, no one, including Sweetin could have seen Full House transitioning into Fuller House two decades ago. Saying to "give it twenty years. We'll see what happens."</p><p>Sweetin has managed to remain successful in acting from childhood through adulthood. Something that is not an easy feat to do. And with the popularity she has garnered with TV movies and reality shows, it does not look like the actress is going anywhere anytime soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWiv4yjpp2hlWLAuLHEraCnZZKasq95yKdkrKGemLJustSlo56qXZ28tr%2FEaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
