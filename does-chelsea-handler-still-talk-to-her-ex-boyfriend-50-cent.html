During a conversation about his ex-girlfriend, the Dear Chelsea star admitted to using a slur at Fiddy, and she knew the moment she said it that he would never speak to her again after that.</p><p>While their relationship didn’t last all that long, Handler had a vacation planned with 50 Cent right before their split, but according to the comedienne, after their argument on the phone, the Grammy winner was a no-show. So, where exactly does the pair’s relationship stand today?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chelsea-handler-talks-50-cent-split>Chelsea Handler Talks 50 Cent Split</h2><p>Following his first appearance on Chelsea Lately in 2009, 50 Cent kept in close contact with the New Jersey native, who was overwhelmed when the rapper started sending flower arrangements to her work.</p><p>In a previous interview, she had gushed, “This is how it started, he was on my show. He was cute, and you know I flirt with all the cute guys on my show.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter Slams 50 Cent's Over Extravagant $175,000 Bid For A Bottle Of Wine</a></span></p><p>“And I thought he was just adorable. Then, he started sending me flowers but ridiculous amounts of like 50 white roses, and it was like laughable. I was like, “Get these out of my office! This is so embarrassing.”</p><p>Things continued to heat up when Fiddy called Handler’s assistant to try and set up a potential date for the two, to which the latter seemed to agree.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She was taken aback by how demanding he was to take her out, but given that she was single and admits to having a thing for African-Americans, Handler went along to see where things between her and 50 Cent would go.</p><p>“So I got on the phone, and he’s not like a grammatical genius and it’s kind of like silly. You should’ve seen some of the texts he used to send me. I’m like, ‘This is so stupid.’ He said some silly line, but it was very cute and I was like, ‘He’s sweet. He’s not carrying a gun right now.’”</p><p>Handler openly admitted that her relationship with 50 Cent was “fun,” confessing that the pair had plenty of intimacy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘50 Cent’: Lil Kim Bites Back After He Compared Her BET Awards Look To An Owl</a></span></p><p>“I told him, ‘I’m going to Nashville this weekend,’ and he said ‘Can I meet you there?’ I was like, ‘Yeah, why not?’ So he came to Nashville to my show. Then, we had sex. Then, he moved to L.A. because he was tape recording so we kind of saw each other for a few of months."</p><p>And while things were great for those few months that they were together, one thing that really seemed to bother her was whatever ties the rap superstar still shared with Ciara at the time, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Huff Post</a>.</p><p>CiCi dated 50 for about a year back in 2007, and according to Handler, when their relationship took off, Ciara was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">very much still trying to get back with the “Window Shopper” hitmaker</a>. To make matters worse, Handler would eventually find herself having to interview the Atlanta native, which made things all the more awkward.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It was so dumb. it’s almost embarrassing. I really can’t remember the exact the details, but I’ll tell you what I can remember,” Handler recalled. “I think one of his ex-girlfriends was coming on my show and she’s one of those singers -I can’t remember her name. She’s really hot. He was dating her I guess previous to me.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">50 Cent Reveals He Lied And Faked His Success Before Making It Big</a></span></p><p>“Ciara–that’s her name!–was coming on the show, and he called me to tell me something about her like she still calls him all the time, and she still tells him that she loves him or something.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“And I’m at my job, and I go “Curtis, honestly this is like eighth grade sh*t. Why are you telling me this? This girl is coming on the show tomorrow, and now I have to look at her and think you guys have some weird thing going on or had going on.”</p><p>“I said something like you’re like a street person basically. Something along the lines of being a gangster, and it was really, really offensive and I hung up and I’ve never spoken to him again.”</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Free Agents’: 50 Cent Thrills Fans As He Starts Training For His Role</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibqJ2jYrCpscusnJplmJa7pbjEq2SsrJmhuW7AwKWiZqyfYrWmvoyer5unqZu%2FqrHNnWRuaF2Ysq%2FAjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
