The day after she was taken into police custody, the “I Want Candy” crooner claimed in a YouTube video that she left him with scratches and bruises and broke her dog Peanut’s leg. Martin has not publicly responded to the allegations.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“So sad, ;( I hope she gets the help she needs,” Carter tweeted at the time. “No one deserves domestic abuse female OR MALE #DomesticAbuse #Cheater she literally chocked [sic] me out…. I’m devastated.”</p><p>The parents-to-be went public with their relationship in January, and Martin moved in with the Nickelodeon alum shortly after. He got <a href=#>her name tattooed on his face</a> in March, the same month that they joined the social media website OnlyFans, which is popular in the adult entertainment industry. The pair shared several nude photos and videos on their joint account, which has since been taken down.</p><p>Carter previously dated <a href=#><strong>Hilary Duff</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Lindsay Lohan</strong></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaamaKku26vwKurnqqjYrSqvsufqaKdnpl6rrHLmqWinV2irrPAyKdkqaqVnLuiutNmmJ%2Bslad6tLzLoqto</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
