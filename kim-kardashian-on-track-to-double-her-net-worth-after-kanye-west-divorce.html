They have already secured a retail space spanning over 5,000 square feet. This store will be situated on Sunset Boulevard, in proximity to popular stores like Supreme and Kilth.</p><p>This is expected to mark the initial store among many, as SKIMS is actively exploring the possibility of opening additional retail outlets in various American cities by the conclusion of 2024.
