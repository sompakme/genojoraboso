Tim Burton’s films talk about that a lot.”</p><p>Bellucci and Burton first sparked romance rumors in February after they were photographed arm-in-arm in Madrid. That same month, they were spotted sharing a kiss outside of a hotel in Paris on Valentine’s Day.</p><p>Some reports at the time suggested that the duo’s relationship began last year after Bellucci presented Burton with an Lumière Film Festival in Lyon, France, in October 2022. Until this week, however, neither of them had commented on the speculation.</p><p>Prior to his romance with Bellucci, Burton was in a long-term relationship with <a href=#><strong>Helena Bonham Carter</strong></a> <a href=#>from 2001 to 2014</a>. Burton and Bonham Carter, 57, share son Billy, 19, and daughter Nell, 15.</p><p>Last year, Bonham Carter described her split from Burton as a “very painful divorce.” In addition to their romantic relationship, the duo had collaborated on a number of films, including Sweeney Todd, Planet of the Apes and Dark Shadows.</p><p>“It was a long-lasting thing,” <a href=#>Bonham Carter said</a> during a December 2022 interview on the “Therapy Works” podcast. “That’s the other thing, it’s not that finite. It never ends. Even if you divorce somebody, it’s a kind of marriage if you have children with them. The relationship has to change. It’s a very complicated thing how to share the children.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Before his relationship with Bonham Carter, Burton was married to artist <strong>Lena Gieseke</strong> from 1987 to 1991. He later moved on with model <strong>Lisa Marie</strong>, whom he dated from 1991 to 2001.</p><p>Bellucci, for her part, married Italian photographer <strong>Claudio Carlos Basso</strong> in 1984, but they divorced after just six months. She later wed French actor <strong>Vincent Cassel</strong> in August 1999. The former couple — who share daughters Deva, 19, and Léonie, 13 — called it quits in August 2013.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamp56esKJ5wZ6jpa2TmLZur86nnaKqnah6s7vMmqWcnV2strW0jK2gpmWSqr%2B1u81mmJ%2Bslad6s8HMqKmsZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
