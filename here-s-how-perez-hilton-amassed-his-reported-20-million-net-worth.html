Perez Hilton is a play on Paris Hilton, and it just shows that he will say anything and do anything to make his reported $20 million net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He has had tons of feuds with celebrities</a> over the years, simply because some people in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood will not stand for some of his opinions</a>, comments, accusations, and even hacking and stalking he's allegedly done. Half the time <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he's apologizing about the things he's said or done.</a></p><p>The bottom line is that he's truly ruthless at what he does, but he gets a pretty impressive paycheck for doing it, unfortunately. Here's exactly how he's amounted $20 million a year.</p><h2 id=how-his-career-started>How His Career Started</h2><p>Born Mario Armando Lavandeira Jr., Hilton is the son of two Cuban immigrants who came to America before he was born. After he graduated prep school, he got a scholarship to Tisch School of Arts at NYU for acting.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He was so interested in acting</a> that he wanted to have a career in it,&nbsp;but after graduating from NYU, he didn't have any success in the industry and instead turned to work for the LGBT rights organization, GLAAD, as a media relations assistant. This was his entry into media and blogging.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Perez Hilton&nbsp;Calls Out Channing Tatum's 'Fake' Reading Photo</a></span></p><p>After his time at GLAAD, he started a position as a receptionist&nbsp;at Urban Outings, a New York City gay events club. During this time he was also a freelance writer for a couple of different LGBT publications.</p><p>Soon he was the managing editor for the gay men's magazine, Instinct, and just two years after graduating college, he moved to L.A., not for a career in acting, but to pursue a career in entertainment writing, because he thought it "seemed easy."</p><p>After being in L.A. for two years, he was able to start his first website,&nbsp;PageSixSixSix.com, where he began to blog about celebrity gossip and entertainment and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">worked hard at it</a>. He worked&nbsp;17-hour days to have 30 stories&nbsp;in just 24 hours.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In just three years the website, now called PerezHilton.com, was deemed "Hollywood's most hated website," by The Insider, because of many of Hilton's opinions of some celebrities, but it instantly made him famous and his following grew exponentially.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Perez Hilton Reposts Katy Perry's Instagram Story, Commenting On Her MTV VMA 'Outfit'</a></span></p><p>Hilton's&nbsp;site, in 2007, was getting millions of viewers daily. His ad prices ranged from $9,000 per week for one advertisement&nbsp;to the highest at $45,000 per week.</p><p>However, around 2014, the website's popularity was reported to be waning.</p><h2 id=he-s-gotten-into-legal-trouble-a-lot>He's Gotten Into Legal Trouble A Lot</h2><p>In 2007, Hilton had a&nbsp;suit against him&nbsp;by Zomba Label Group, after he illegally posted 10 full&nbsp;songs&nbsp;by Britney Spears. That same year, Hilton was cleared of a defamation case against him concerning false accusations against Samatha Ronson. Since Hilton got his information from another site, who had already resolved the case with Ronson, Hilton was awarded $85,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hilton has also been linked to suits with Colin Farrell and Jennifer Anniston, for illegally posting videos and pictures of the actors. In general, Hilton seems to post about anything he wants, and he takes anything he needs to do it.</p><p>He made his net worth even higher (and he needed to with all the suits against him at the time) when he formed his radio show, Radio Perez, in 2008.</p><p>Now, after apologizing for his often bullying ways in 2010, he has made three more websites,&nbsp;one on fashion, called CoCoPerez.com, one on fitness, called FitPerez.com, and another on animal rights, TeddyHilton.com.</p><p>He has also moved to Youtube as well and has two vlogs, Perez Hilton and&nbsp;Perez Hilton and Family, and has a podcast with Chris Booker called The Perez Hilton Podcast with Chris Booker.</p><p>He has two books with extremely long names;&nbsp;<i>Red Carpet Suicide: A Survival Guide on Keeping Up With the Hiltons,&nbsp;</i><i>Perez Hilton's True Bloggywood Stories: The Glamorous Life of Beating, Cheating, and Overdosing,&nbsp;</i>and a children's book, The Boy with Pink Hair.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-makes-money-on-tv-too>He Makes Money On TV Too</h2><p>In 2007, Hilton had a brief six-episode reality television show on VH1, called&nbsp;<i>What Perez Sez.&nbsp;</i>The same year he was also a contestant on MTV's <i>Celebrity Rap Superstar&nbsp;</i>and hosted an episode of&nbsp;<i>Best of MADtv.&nbsp;</i></p><p>He has credits appearing in music videos for Simple Plan's "When I'm Gone", The Pussycat Dolls's "Hush Hush", Rihanna's "S&M" and other reality shows like&nbsp;<i>Victoria Beckham: Coming to America</i>, <i>MTV Cribs</i>, The N's <i>Queen Bees</i>, <i>Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List, Tori Spelling THS</i> and <i>Paris Hilton's My New BFF</i>.</p><p>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Perez Hilton Apologizes For Anti-Autistic Blunder 'I Feel Like An Idiot'</a></p><p>He is also a regular on shows like&nbsp;TRL, MuchMusic, and Extra, created the British show,&nbsp;<i>Perez Hilton Superfan&nbsp;</i>in 2011, and in 2015, appeared on the British show,&nbsp;<i>Celebrity Big Brother.</i></p><p>In 2017, Hilton was crowned "Best of the Worst"&nbsp;in the show&nbsp;Worst Cooks in America.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hilton has also starred in two off-broadway productions,&nbsp;<i>NEWSical The Musical,&nbsp;</i>as himself, and&nbsp;<i>Full House! The Musical,&nbsp;</i>as Danny Tanner.</p><p>Despite being one of Hollywood's notorious trolls on the internet, Hilton has made an impressive living on it. Does anyone else wish they could spout their opinions of celebrities for millions of dollars? You might have to be as ruthless as him though, to get it done.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Perez Hilton Posts Shocking Video Of Trump And His Wife, Fans React: 'Free Melania'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHqpu9Zmp56qla96qbXLraanZZGirrS%2FxJ1koaGjYr%2BmvM6rq56cXWd9brnIpaOip55iu6bAjLCmq6yYZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
