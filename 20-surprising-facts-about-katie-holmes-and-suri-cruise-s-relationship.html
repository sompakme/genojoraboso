Cruise was quick to announce to the world on the now infamous Oprah episode that he was in love by jumping up and down on her set couch like a hyperactive child.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The pair were inseparable, had their beautiful daughter Suri, and then were married. As the secrecy surrounding Tom and his spiritual affiliations lit up the press, curiosity about their relationship peaked. When Katie Holmes filed for divorce in 2012, she began a new journey, one as essentially a single mom who made it her mission to raise daughter Suri on her own terms, without Tom’s controlling influence. Today let’s look at 20 surprising facts about Katie Holmes and Suri Cruise’s relationship and how they navigate their relationship both in and out of the public eye.</p><h2 id=taking-care-of-tantrums-during-the-wedding><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>Taking Care Of Tantrums During The Wedding</span></h2><p>Little kids are prone to temper tantrums. Throw in a lot of strangers and pressure to be the perfect little flower girl and they’re bound to have a melt down. In her book, Leah Remini talks about Katie Holmes not noticing that Suri was crying in a nearby washroom during her wedding to Tom. When Remini went to investigate, several caregivers, including Tom’s sister, stood above the toddler repeatedly saying, ‘Suri, Suri, Suri!’ repeatedly, but doing nothing to help calm the tot. Bizarre.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mom-couldn-t-date-for-five-years-post-divorce><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>Mom Couldn't Date For Five Years Post Divorce</span></h2><p>In order to get a quick and painless divorce from Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes agreed to a few things to speed up the process. A close source said, "Katie signed a clause in her quickie divorce settlement that prevents her from embarrassing Tom in various ways, like talking about him (or his spiritual affiliations), or publicly dating another man for five years after the divorce." She also was not allowed to allow any romantic suitors near Suri during this five-year time period.</p><h2 id=control-from-dad-that-happened-in-utero><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>Control From Dad That Happened In Utero</span></h2><p>Tom and Katie were so excited about having a child they wanted to see her whenever they wanted to, not just during regularly scheduled doctor appointments. During an interview with Barbara Walters, Tom shared that he had purchased a personal sonogram machine for his and Katie’s use only. Some say this showcased some of Tom’s controlling behaviour. Either way he planned to donate it to a hospital in need when he was done using it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=designer-mother-daughter-wardrobes><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Designer Mother Daughter Wardrobes</span></h2><p>Celeb kids are in the public eye, often, whether they like it or not. Once she was old enough Tom and Katie made sure she’d look good when being photographed. Thanks to a team of helpers Suri was named ‘Hollywood’s Hottest Tot’ because she was mentioned in online blogs more often than any other famous offspring. At the time her wardrobe was believed to be worth 3.2 million dollars, including $150,000 in shoes alone. By the time she was picking out items herself, a source said of Suri’s taste, “She’s a massive fan of Marc Jacobs and she's had several shoes custom-made, so if they didn't come with a heel, Katie had them redesigned for Suri. She commissioned a pair of Louboutins for her a while back."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=protecting-suri-from-the-church-during-the-split><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Protecting Suri From The Church During The Split</span></h2><p>Since Tom Cruise is very rich, powerful, and a person of influence, Katie needed to plan her divorce quickly to prevent it from being blocked by many of Tom’s people. Karen De La Carriere who was formerly associated with Tom and the church said of the divorce proceedings Katie, "had to have planned this very carefully, right down to using disposable cell phones and laptops to throw people off her trail. It had to have been a very cloak-and-dagger operation."</p><h2 id=a-single-mom-since-suri-was-seven><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>A Single Mom Since Suri Was Seven</span></h2><p>Once Katie’s marriage ended, some of the earlier excesses of Suri’s young childhood came to an end. This meant the million-dollar wardrobes were gone. Since Katie had left the church, Tom became estranged from his daughter. A source close to the family told InTouch, "He's disconnected from Katie, and then de facto from Suri, because of her connection to Katie. He hasn't seen her since she was 7."</p><h2 id=the-silent-birth><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>The Silent Birth</span></h2><p>Everyone was curious about the arrival of Tomcat’s child. Because of Tom’s strict views he wanted to make sure that Suri came into this world through a silent birth since he believes that any words spoken during the process of labour and childbirth can leave a long-lasting impression on both mom and child. We’re unsure whether a pant, groan, or scream of pain was uttered during Suri’s arrival.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=coffee-buddies><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Coffee Buddies</span></h2><p>As a doting mom, Katie is rarely spotted without Suri at her side. It turns out Suri picked up a taste for coffee from her mom, from the time she was very young. Suri has been photographed many times with a coffee in her hands, with some reports of Suri enjoying a piping hot coffee to herself since the tender age of four.</p><h2 id=late-nights-on-the-town-together><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Late Nights On The Town Together</span></h2><p>Apparently young Suri needs her espresso for a reason, as mom likes to keep her up late, particularly when they enjoy the culture of New York, the city that never sleeps. Katie has been known to take Suri to galleries, museums, the theatre, and other cultural events, whether they’re at 10am or 10pm.</p><h2 id=navigating-epic-tantrums><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Navigating Epic Tantrums</span></h2><p>All kids tantrum, just most of us are lucky enough that photographers aren’t snapping shots of us dealing with yet another meltdown. Naturally in the time following Tom and Katie’s split all cameras were on Katie and Suri. This pressure, Suri’s young age, and the aftermath of a divorce all led to more meltdowns, with many of them caught on camera.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-suri-and-kate-were-cut-off-from-family><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>When Suri And Kate Were Cut Off From Family</span></h2><p>There are rumours that Tom restricted Katie’s contact with her family during their marriage, which meant the same restrictions for Suri. Tom was said to even open Katie’s mail as a way to control her and monitor her actions. Today both Katie and Suri enjoy their personal, unrestricted relationship with her family.</p><h2 id=how-a-trip-to-whole-foods-became-a-pr-stunt><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>How A Trip To Whole Foods Became a 'PR Stunt'</span></h2><p>Sometimes it’s a slow news day, it happens. Unfortunately for celebs like Katie Holmes and daughter Suri, it means that several of their trips to Whole Foods become newsworthy stories. There has been speculation over whether Katie and Suri have access to a ‘secret’ entrance to a New York Whole Foods in order to avoid the press. Let’s just let the two shop in peace, okay?</p><h2 id=a-lesson-in-responsibility-through-puppy-care><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>A Lesson In Responsibility Through Puppy Care</span></h2><p>Like many normal families, parents will often allow a child to care for pets to learn important lessons in empathy and responsibility. Now that Suri is a teenager, mom has allowed her to take some solo walks with their two dogs through the streets of Manhattan, increasing her independence. Just the same paparazzi were there to get the moment on film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mom-encourages-reading-the-handmaid-s-tale><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Mom Encourages Reading The Handmaid's Tale</span></h2><p>While online reviews for the book The Handmaid’s Tale suggest a minimum age of 16 for readers, it seems that Katie likes to encourage Suri to push herself to read great and relevant literature. It’s nice to see that there are no ‘banned books’ in this household as Suri is photographed with the book on the way out to visit a friend with her mom.</p><h2 id=a-national-daughter-s-day-tribute><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>A National Daughter's Day Tribute</span></h2><p>While Holmes isn’t one to reveal too much on her social media account about her relationship with Suri, she couldn’t help but gush about Suri on National Daughter’s Day. Holmes shared a photo of a painting of a mother and a child and was sure to add in a bunch of heart emojis and the tagline for National Daughter’s Day to show Suri, and all her followers, that she’s thinking about her daughter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=katie-puts-parenting-first-and-foremost><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Katie Puts Parenting First And Foremost</span></h2><p>Katie understands that we only get to borrow our children for a short period of time, which is probably why she is so involved with Suri throughout her childhood. Holmes said, “Every day, kids get a little further away from you. That's a positive thing. They should be becoming more independent, but it's heartbreaking. You want them to stay with you forever, but they're these amazing beings, and you must do everything you can to give them what they need — and then they're going to go. And that's going to be very, very sad for me."</p><h2 id=like-mother-like-daughter><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Like Mother Like Daughter</span></h2><p>Now that Suri is approaching the age that Katie was when she first hit the limelight, it’s become more apparent that the acorn doesn’t fall far from the tree. Suri is now 13 years old, just six years younger than her mom was when she entered everyone’s houses through her iconic role of Josephine Potter on Dawson’s Creek.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-potential-to-reconcile-co-parenting-with-tom><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>A Potential To Reconcile Co-Parenting With Tom?</span></h2><p>News sites are begging for Suri and her dad to reconnect. A source told Okay! Magazine, Suri has been begging her dad to reconnect and that in turn "He's contacted Suri through a third party, who he trusts implicitly, to check in and make sure she's OK. He wants her to know that he's thought of her all this time and he got all of her messages. In fact, he read and listened to each and every word. Tom's paving the way to come back into Suri's life permanently and many expect it to happen soon."</p><h2 id=mom-wants-to-let-suri-just-be-a-kid><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Mom Wants To Let Suri 'Just Be A Kid'</span></h2><p>Katie’s back to roots approach to parenting post divorce has been apparent to everyone who sees her hands-on parenting day to day. Holmes said, "My child is the most important person to me, and her upbringing is paramount to my work right now. It's very important that I'm present and she has a stable, innocent childhood. I feel so blessed to do what I do, but there's nothing in the world better than watching your child succeed."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=experiencing-all-new-york-has-to-offer-together><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Experiencing All New York Has To Offer, Together</span></h2><p>A mom who loves theatre and acting is bound to want to share that experience with her child and Katie is no different. Katie has taken Suri to see many Broadway shows over the years including Cats, School of Rock, and Kinky Boots. The two have also been known to head backstage to meet with the stars, like Ben Blatt, the star of Dear Evan Hansen, in 2017.</p><p>Sources: Nicki Swift, Pop Culture, Good Morning America, Metro, The Talko, Redbook Magazine, Okay!
