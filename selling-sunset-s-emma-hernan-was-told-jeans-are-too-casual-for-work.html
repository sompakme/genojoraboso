On Selling Sunset, we definitely turn up for y’all. We are definitely glam girls. We love to bring the fashion, so we get glammed to film, for the most part … and it is out of our pockets.”</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Lazkani added: “No one pays for our glam. Nobody pays for our outfits. Some of the girls have stylists. I myself do not. I dress and style myself.
