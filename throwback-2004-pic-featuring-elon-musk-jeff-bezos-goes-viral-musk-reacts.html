A user with the Twitter handle TrungTPhan took to the social media site to show a photo of Jeff Bezos, still sporting salt-and-pepper hair on his now-famously bald head, raising a metal cup to his grinning face. He's turned towards the camera as an incredibly fresh-faced Elon Musk flashes a bright white smile from next to him."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He offers little information on the restaurant, but goes into detail on the conversation. The meeting, according to the poster was to discuss space travel. Bezos, he claims, had set out to pick Elon's brain about rockets for his space company, Blue Origins. It predated Elon's SpaceX by two years and it seemed that he hoped to get some thoughts on future plans.</p><p>Musk wasn't impressed with Bezo's progress when they met and spoke about it after the fact.&nbsp; Some of Jeff's ideas had already been implemented and failed under the SpaceX watch. His exact quote may have been a bit blunter as apparently, Elon replied, "Dude, we tried that and that turned out to be really dumb."</p><p>The irony of this picture is that today, Jeff Bezos is retiring from his Amazon throne to focus more on Blue Origin. While his new project might not be new, it's still light years behind Elon's creation. Yet, the hope is that he will be able to catch up and bridge the gap that seemingly started around 2004 when Musk embraced space while Jeff conquered the Amazon of retail sales.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> he saw this photograph</a> seemingly taken at a pivotal moment in both men's lives, Elon Musk had a response that seemed to be as underwhelming to those salivating for details as Bezos's plans were to him back at the 2004 meal.</p><p>"Wow, hard to believe that was 17 years ago!" Musk tweeted.</p><p>The next battle may be in the stars, but it started with a table full of empty water bottles and two billionaires-to-be dreaming bigger than anyone thought possible.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Investor Sues Elon Musk, Tesla Over "Erratic" Tweets</a></span></p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">News 18</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hindustan Times</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Republic World</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS3prLFZpmesp%2Boeqa4zqdkpq2joHquscClZK2nl5rBqbHRZq2iqpGherG0zq2mZqynnsG1sdFo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
