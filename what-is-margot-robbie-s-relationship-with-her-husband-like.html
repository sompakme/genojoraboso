Her husband, Tom Ackerley, is a producer but he's clearly not as well-known as his wife.</p><p>The pair started dating back in 2014, the same year they -- along with other co-founders -- started a production company. Still, fans aren't sure it's been smooth sailing for the couple, and an interesting Reddit question brought out some fan theories.</p><h2 id=margot-is-very-private-about-her-personal-life>Margot Is Very Private About Her Personal Life</h2><p>Margot is so secretive about her personal life that her Wikipedia page even has an entry that states how private she is. Yet some fans of her work question whether she's keeping things under wraps for a specific reason.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The fan <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posed the question</a> of whether anyone had tea on Margot and her husband but followed up by saying they'd heard rumors that Robbie was getting intimate with other people in a bid to get to the top in Hollywood.</p><p>Other commenters seemed to agree that was a laughable accusation but also something that many other actresses have been accused of as well.</p><p>Unfortunately, it's a common trope that any actress who is successful has done "favors" to get to where she is. And fans don't think Robbie needed that kind of "help" to grow her career.</p><h2 id=fans-think-margot-39-s-husband-quot-gets-quot-her-job>Fans Think Margot's Husband "Gets" Her Job</h2><p>Though some commenters had troll-like things to say about how Margot Robbie became famous, others suggest that rumors are just that and that Tom Ackerley probably doesn't have anything to worry about.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And as one fan pointed out, "they seem to have a pretty solid relationship seeing as they have a production company together."</p><p>Another echoed the same sentiment; "He’s always with her so ofc he would know [the rumors are] complete [expletive]."</p><p>Besides, fans say, nearly every blonde in Hollywood has been accused of the same thing, and it mostly has to do with her beauty.</p><p>The consensus is that any beautiful actress will be "shipped" with her co-stars, like that time people argued over <a href=#>Margot and Leonardo DiCaprio hooking up</a>. And the rumors persist whether or not the star in question is dating someone, engaged, or even married.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But, fans say, Tom doesn't seem to be concerned about any of it, and as a movie producer, he likely understands the industry perfectly well.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Here's How Margot Robbie's Life Has Changed Since Becoming Harley Quinn</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecyaqaCnpGK%2FsK7BopysZaKauaLAyKilrKCZpXq4tdOhZKGdomK1tr%2FBmqWdZZyeuKZ7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
