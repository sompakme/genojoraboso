Now imagine how much more concerned you may be about it&nbsp;if you're a celebrity and your look was what helped make you famous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For 7 women on our list, they clearly have embraced their good looks and don't hesitate to strip it off in a variety of mediums - including an upcoming movie you may not know about. They do so while also being often outspoken about how empowering or sexy it makes them feel.</p><p>For 8 of the women on our list, they also might not hesitate to strip the clothes off, but that doesn't mean the reaction is always positive. Even if, as you'll learn, the women being slammed are still gorgeous.</p><p>Don't think we're going to leave these women unguarded though, as we include some of the best responses to body-shaming.</p><p>Here are the 7&nbsp;hottest celebrities who we love seeing show off their body, and 8&nbsp;who've been shamed into trying to stop.</p><h2 id=told-to-stop---amy-schumer><strong>Told To Stop - Amy Schumer</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amy Schumer</a> is no stranger to controversy. Whether it's people insulting her movies (even though Trainwreck at the very least, was successful) or her standup comedy, or as Schumer has quickly learned as well; her body.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yet leave it to the comedian to have a sassy comment, taking to the internet to say</p><p>"I am a size 6 and have no plans of changing. This is it. Stay on or get off. Kisses!"</p><p>And while Schumer's latest film Snatched isn't succeeding at the box office or with critics perhaps as well as she had hoped, she recently landed another movie deal with STXFilms purchasing her new comedy I Feel Pretty.</p><h2 id=glad---scarlett-johansson><strong>Glad - Scarlett Johansson</strong></h2><p>If you're a fan of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scarlett Johansson</a>, it may be because she is an outstanding actress and has shown it off in a variety of genres. I mean sure, her roles in the Avengers comes to mind because how does it not; but don't discredit her other successful ones such as Vicky Christina Barcelona or Lost In Translation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But one thing is for sure, no matter where Johansson shows up she's probably going to look good doing it. Johansson has also been named the most beautiful women in the world be Esquire on two separate occasions, so you know she is also no stranger to stepping in front of the camera for a revealing photo shoot. Johansson has also acted in her birthday suit for the movie&nbsp;Under the Skin.&nbsp;</p><p>Something that we're sure if she keeps doing, you definitely won't have a problem with.</p><h2 id=told-to-stop---selena-gomez><strong>Told To Stop - Selena Gomez</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Selena Gomez</a> has grown increasingly confident in showing off her body over the years; including choosing to wear absolutely nothing on the cover of her single "Kill em With Kindness"</p><p>And with the weather getting hotter, Gomez definitely will plan to be enjoying some beach time. &nbsp;But when Gomez did just that back in 2015, she quickly found herself getting told to stop!</p><p>"It was the first time I'd ever been called fat. But it was weird because it's not just, 'Oh, she's fat.' It’s like, 'She's a mess. She's gone off the deep end.' I'm like, because I'm on a vacation wearing a bathing suit? Actually, technically, that is a little too small for me, but I didn't care," said Gomez when talking to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ellen</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We're sure the haters aren't going to keep her from stripping it off in the near future.</p><h2 id=glad---hilary-duff><strong>Glad - Hilary Duff</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hilary Duff</a> is no stranger to being under the public eye. After all, she's been acting since Lizzie McGuire back in 2001; but she definitely never has looked better then she does right now.</p><p>Granted when you consider that after her divorce to Mike Comrie, she dated a personal trainer! And while Hillary has been at the stranger of body-shaming, especially following the birth of her son, we need to commend her for taking the steps she needed to lose the weight in a healthy way including saying in past interview</p><p>"I think if you ask any pregnant mom, they're like 'I want my body back,' but it takes time. It takes nine months for your body to get that way and it's putting on that weight on purpose."</p><p>After fellow actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tia Mowry</a> gave birth, she also stated in a past interview that Duff was one of her role models.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=told-to-stop---emma-stone><strong>Told To Stop - Emma Stone</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emma Stone</a> has plenty of reason to be feeling confident with herself. Not only does she look gorgeous anytime she steps in front of a camera, her talent has never been more evident than in&nbsp;La La Land&nbsp;which won her an Academy Award.</p><p>Yet while Stone may look stunning, she's still been the subject of people telling her that she needs to start covering it up</p><p>"I've seen a lot of comments that say, 'Eat a sandwich' or 'She looks sick.' I've been looking at myself in the mirror being mean to myself. I'm not sick. I eat sandwiches," said Stone, as well as</p><p>"I've shamed myself for it. We shame each other online. We're always too skinny or too fat or too tall or too short. It bothers me because I care so much about young girls."</p><h2 id=glad---katy-perry><strong>Glad - Katy Perry</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Katy Perry</a> is one of the most talented musicians, but there is no denying that part of her appeal is the fact that she's absolutely gorgeous. And while Katy Perry hasn't stripped it all off for any major publications; there are plenty of photos of Perry still electing to show off plenty of her birthday suit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not to mention the fact that Perry's music videos, including her most recent for "Bon Appetite" consistently go viral not only for the music; but the saucy outfits that she finds herself in.</p><p>Now that Perry is single following her breakup with Bloom, we're sure people will be all in favor of seeing her show off some skin this summer.</p><h2 id=told-to-stop---kendall-jenner><strong>Told To Stop - Kendall Jenner</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kendall Jenner</a> has been having herself a pretty awful 2017. I mean sure, the Pepsi commercial seemed like a great gig at the time, but we all know how that turned out for her!</p><p>While Jenner is an accomplished model, that also means she is no stranger to people coming out and attacking how she looks.</p><p>"I'm constantly criticized for being too skinny. I'm trying to gain weight but my body won't let it happen. What people don't understand is that calling someone too skinny is the same as calling someone too fat, it's not a nice feeling," said Jenner in a past interview.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Let's hope she has learned a lot about who her true support system is in this year and uses them to help keep her feeling confident.</p><h2 id=glad---hailey-baldwin><strong>Glad - Hailey Baldwin</strong></h2><p>When it comes to deciding who the hottest celebrity is, one of the biggest factors (y'know outside of personal preference) is looking at the major magazine publishers.</p><p>For example, Maxim has been putting out their "Top 100" list for years now and you'll be happy to know you're staring at the woman who came in at #1!</p><p>Baldwin is an aspiring model and if you're wondering about the last name; she is the daughter of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephen Baldwin</a> who is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alec</a>'s brother.</p><p>While Alec had himself a great 2017 in part due to his hilarious <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trump</a> impersonation, something tells us you'd much rather be staring at his niece.</p><h2 id=told-to-stop---bella-thorne><strong>Told To Stop - Bella Thorne</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bella Thorne</a> is an accomplished actress and is currently appearing in the series Famous In Love. But when she isn't lighting up the television screen, she's lighting up the internet by posting various photos of her in various states of undress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With the weather getting hotter, you better believe swimsuits are also going to make an appearance on a regular basis, but if you're hating on Thorne she has words for you:</p><p>"If a girl wears a bathing suit, she is a ho and is body-shamed. If you don’t show your body, you’re a prude. You take pictures with a guy and you’re a ho; you take pictures with a girlfriend and you’re a lesbian. I don’t understand how girls can sit there and pick one another apart."</p><h2 id=glad---ariel-winter><strong>Glad - Ariel Winter</strong></h2><p>When it comes to reasons as to why celebrities show off their body because it's fun to do so is as good a reason as any we suppose.</p><p>At least it is for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariel Winter</a>, who stated in a past interview</p><p>"I don’t really think I’m telling myself, ‘You should post this, you shouldn’t post that. I feel like I’m just having fun. I like my fans to see what I’m doing," it just turns out that she often does things while wearing little amounts of clothing!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Winter has also gone on to say,</p><p>"Everybody is so hyped up on the fact that I post photos where my butt's out. ... You should be posting your butt if you like it, too!"</p><h2 id=told-to-stop---kelly-clarkson><strong>Told To Stop - Kelly Clarkson</strong></h2><p>There have been many American Idol winners, but you always remember your first; and in that case, we have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelly Clarkson</a>. Clarkson managed to continue her success following the show and while staying in the public eye for her talent is great, a number of times she's been knocked down for her weight fluctuations is anything but.</p><p>Clarkson has spoken out in the past about her feelings on the matter,</p><p>"It's like, you are who you are. And it doesn't mean that you're going to be that [way] forever. Sometimes I'm more fit and I get into kickboxing hardcore. And sometimes I don't and I'd rather have a glass of wine."</p><p>At least if the haters get too annoying she probably has a few favorite types of wine!</p><h2 id=glad---paris-jackson><strong>Glad - Paris Jackson</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paris Jackson</a> knew she was going to grow up in the public eye. But unlike her incredibly famous (and deceased) father, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Jackson</a>, Paris has elected to attempt to become an actress and model. Part of her attempts includes her being comfortable stepping out on the town wearing little to no clothing, a trend she also follows on her Instagram.</p><p>Don't expect Jackson to stop anytime soon though, as she once said in an interview</p><p>"The human body is a beautiful thing and no matter what 'flaws' you have, whether it be cars, or extra weight, stretch marks, freckles, whatever, it is beautiful and you should express yourself however you feel comfortable," as well as talking openly about how she is often naked at home.</p><p>It's an empowering message and one that'll get reaffirmed every time she shows off some skin.</p><h2 id=told-to-stop---tyra-banks><strong>Told To Stop - Tyra Banks</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tyra Banks</a> is one of the most successful and recognizable models of all-time. On top of rocking the runway, she's also been successful in a variety of television formats including her own talk show (aptly named The Tyra Banks Show).</p><p>This gave her the perfect platform to shout back at body shamers online who were clamoring for her to cover up following a trip to the beach,</p><p>"To all you that have something nasty to say about me, or other women that are built like me. I have one thing to say to you. 'Kiss my fat ass!'" said Banks.</p><p>Banks recently made her debut as the host of America's Got Talent.</p><h2 id=glad---emily-ratajkowski><strong>Glad - Emily Ratajkowski</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emily Ratajkowski</a> may have come to fame in the music video "Blurred Lines" by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robin Thicke</a>, but she's clearly working hard to make sure her career lasts a lot longer than Thicke's.</p><p>It definitely helps that she is no stranger to taking to the internet and sharing photos of her in little to no clothing; much to the delight of her 13 million followers on Instagram. Ratajkowski is also attempting to make is an actress and will be baring it all in her upcoming film Welcome Home To Italy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ratajkowski is clearly comfortable posting racy photos of herself though, which she has stated in past interviews she does for her own enjoyment and pleasure. As well as this, she feels it's incredibly empowering; all reasons as to why she probably won't stop doing it anytime soon.</p><h2 id=told-to-stop---demi-lovato><strong>Told To Stop - Demi Lovato</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Demi Lovato</a> has had plenty of struggles in her personal life when it comes to her overall appearance. And while you may think she looks gorgeous, that doesn't mean that she hasn't had her fair share of haters over the years that are trying to bring her down.</p><p>Don't think they're going to get to her anymore though,</p><p>“If somebody calls me fat, even in a vulnerable moment, I laugh to myself and think, I’m doing everything I can, so there’s nothing I can do about it. I don’t have a six-pack. Maybe I don’t even want a six-pack. It doesn’t sound very appealing," said Lovato in an interview.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite saying she doesn't want a six-pack, Lovato certainly spends enough time at the gym to achieve one!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZwZZOauaau0maunqqVYrStrcNmqqGnp2K8p7KMrZ%2BeoaJir7Cw2GaYp5xdbXq4tM5mrp6qlWLBsLjDZquoZaOpvLF7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
