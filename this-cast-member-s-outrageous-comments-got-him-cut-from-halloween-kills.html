As a result, there have been loads of <a href=#>horror movie villains</a> over the years but only a handful of them are considered to be among the most legendary. Of course, there is no doubt that Michael Myers from the Halloween film franchise is considered to be one of the greatest horror movie villains of all time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>An Inside Look At 'Halloween' Carnage By The Hands Of Michael Myers</a></span></p><p>Due to the legendary status of Michael Myers, lots of actors would love to share the screen with the intimidating character in a Halloween movie. With that in mind, it is amazing that one actor who claimed to be cast in 2021’s Halloween Kills likely was cut from the film due to some truly outrageous comments they made in the past.</p><h2 id=jamie-lee-curtis-almost-refused-to-return-to-halloween>Jamie Lee Curtis Almost Refused To Return To Halloween</h2><p>Even though Halloween is now considered to be one of the best horror movies of all time, it was produced by a bunch of people with no real experience in the film industry. For example, the film’s main star, Jamie Lee Curtis, was making her film debut in the film. As a result of her inexperience and the fact that Halloween was produced on a shoestring budget, <a href=#>Curtis was paid next to nothing to star in Halloween</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, even though Jamie Lee Curtis’ Halloween paycheque was tiny, she still must thank her lucky stars that she starred in the film. After all, <a href=#>many Halloween actors enjoyed successful careers</a> after its release including Curtis who became a major movie star due to the film’s popularity. Even though Curtis has taken on a lot of notable roles over the years, she is still best known as Halloween’s Laurie Strode which makes a lot of sense. After all, Curtis has portrayed Strode in six films to date and she is set to return to the role for at least one more to come.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Still Aren't Tired Of Jamie Lee Curtis As Laurie Strode, 44 Years Later</a></span></p><p>After Jamie Lee Curtis starred in Halloween, Halloween II, Halloween H20: 20 Years Later, and Halloween: Resurrection, it seemed like her time with the franchise was over. However, when writer and director David Gordon Green began plans to make 2018’s Halloween reboot, he wanted to bring Curtis back to the series. However, Curtis wasn’t interested in a return to her most famous role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fortunately for David Gordon Green, he directed the movie Stronger which starred Jamie Lee Curtis’ godson Jake Gyllenhaal. After not being able to get her enthused in the project, Green reached out to Gyllenhaal and asked him to get Curtis to at least meet with him. Due to the respect he had for Green, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gyllenhaal tracked down Curtis while she was on vacation</a> in the mountains and after Jake talked to her, Jamie met with David and the rest is history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-original-michael-myers-may-have-been-cut-from-halloween-kills>The Original Michael Myers May Have Been Cut From Halloween Kills</h2><p>As of the time of this writing, there have been thirteen movies in the Halloween franchise. As a result, many different actors have gotten the chance to portray the series’ main villain Michael Myers and that is now considered a great honor. When 1978’s Halloween was produced, however, nobody knew that Myers was going to be considered an all-time great character. For that reason, it didn’t seem like a big deal to anyone at the time that more than one actor portrayed Myers in the original film.</p><p>Throughout the vast majority of the scenes where Michael Myers appears in 1978’s Halloween, the character was embodied by a man named Nick Castle. However, the decision was made to have Tony Moran bring Myers to life for a scene where he was very briefly seen without his mask. Even though it was for only one scene, playing Myers in 1978’s Halloween earned Moran a place in horror history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though horror movies can be very dark and grisly, the community of fans that enjoy scary movies tends to be very loving. Unfortunately, however, just because the horror community was waiting to embrace Tony Moran for his role in horror history doesn’t mean that he has shown love to the people who made him famous. Instead, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Moran has become infamous for making many outrageous claims</a> during public events.</p><p>Some of the things that Tony Moran has said in the past that have outraged fans include accusing Halloween director John Carpenter and its star Jamie Lee Curtis of misconduct. Even though Moran wasn’t uninvolved with Rob Zombie’s Halloween films, he has also taken aim at people involved with them too. For example, Moran has called the actor who played Michael Myers in those films, Tyler Mane, things that are too offensive to be quoted here.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Has Jamie Lee Curtis Earned From All ‘Halloween’ Movies</a></span></p><p>Of course, there is no way for anyone who wasn’t on the set of 1978’s Halloween to know for sure how John Carpenter and Jamie Lee Curtis conducted themselves. However, many of the people who worked on Halloween have been interviewed about the production and have nothing but praise for Carpenter and Curtis. With that in mind and the things that Moran has said about Tyler Mane, most horror fans have written him off.</p><p>When the franchise was rebooted with 2018’s Halloween, original Michael Myers actor Nick Castle was given a cameo appearance. In the lead-up to the release of that film’s sequel, Halloween Kills, Tony Moran revealed that he’d been asked to make a cameo appearance as well. Despite Moran’s checkered past, it is easy to take his claim seriously since several actors from 1978’s Halloween appeared in Halloween Kills.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Halloween Kills was released in 2021, it didn’t take long for people to take note of the fact that Tony Moran didn’t appear. Given the fact that in recent years several actors have been cut from films after they got embroiled in controversy, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">many people have concluded that Moran was cut due to his past comments</a>. While that certainly hasn’t been confirmed, it seems very likely that is the case.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>How 'Halloween Kills' Sets Up The Final Chapter In The Michael Myers Saga</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddrK60ecKuq2aeoqS6brTApaOor5Wau263yKWjrGWTlsC1edOopbJlnaS%2ForqO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
