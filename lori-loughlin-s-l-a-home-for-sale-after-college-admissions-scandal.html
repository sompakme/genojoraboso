That year, Loughlin served two months in prison while Giannulli served five months behind bars.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Lori-Loughlin-Lists-L-A-Home-for-Sale-5-Years-After-College-Admissions-Scandal-164.jpg><p>Loughlin and Giannulli purchased their Hidden Hills home amid the scandal, majorly downsizing from the Bel Air home they previously owned. They originally listed their former home for $35 million in 2017, per Robb Report, and then again with a price reduction for $28.65 million in 2020. They finally unloaded the home for $18.75 million, Million Dollar Listing: Los Angeles star <strong>Josh Flagg</strong>, who represented the buyer, confirmed at the time.</p><p>Since the scandal, Loughlin and Giannulli — and their daughters — have done their best to move on with their lives.</p><p>Olivia Jade opened up about the <a href=#>biggest “misconceptions”</a> about the scandal involving her family during a January 2022 episode of her “Conversations With Olivia Jade” podcast.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“There is a big misconception about me, I feel at least personally, where I get that comment of, ‘You don’t work hard.’ I didn’t have to start my YouTube when I was 14, I did put in a lot of work,” the YouTuber said at the time. “There’s always rumors floating around about my grades: ‘She clearly didn’t work hard. She must have failed school.’ I don’t even think I’ve ever said this publicly, but in high school, I had straight A’s and I worked really hard at school.”</p><p>During her conversation with <strong>Dr. Hillary Goldsher</strong> at the time, Olivia Jade said she started therapy after “things went sideways” for their family, but she admitted it’s tough to talk about the scandal because of her “privileged life.”</p><p>“I am super aware that I’ve been given opportunities because of my parents and I know that I live a very blessed and fortunate and privileged life,” the YouTuber added. “But then there’s also a part of me that feels … it’s tricky. It’s hard to speak on because I know that to the average human, I have it easy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalp6Keeq271KCfpaGeqHqtecBmn6illWKzsL6MrJilnV2Ws7Wx0WaaqKScmrSmecCdpKKro568r7%2BMrJqappSWuXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
