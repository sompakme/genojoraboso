Only 100 bottles of the condiment will be made — 13 + 87, Swift’s lucky number and Kelce’s jersey digits — and fans can head to the official Heinz Instagram to find out more on how they can purchase the product."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

At one point during the game, a photo was snapped that featured Swift posing with a fan while snacking on fried chicken.

The pop star attended the game on Travis’ invite after he saw her Kansas City Eras Tour performance in July.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“I told her, ‘You know, I’ve seen you rock the stage in Arrowhead [Stadium], you might <a href=#>have to come see me rock the stage</a> in Arrowhead and see which one’s a little more lit,’” he said on “<a href=# rel=noopener>The Pat McAfee Show</a>” on Thursday, September 21. “So, we’ll see what happens in the near future.”</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Swift accepted and was in the crowd — fully decked out in Chiefs swag — three days later. The twosome <a href=#>were later seen leaving the grounds together</a>, hopping into a purple convertible before driving off into the night.
