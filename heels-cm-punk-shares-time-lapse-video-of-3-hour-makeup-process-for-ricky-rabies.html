CM Punk posted the following video of the makeup application process for his character, Ricky Rabies, on the new STARZ series Heels. Punk previously teased posting the video and told WrestleZone that he’d likely wait until his debut episode premiered on the network.
“Yeah, I 100% am. I think I’m going to wait until episode three comes out. I might shoot it out there sooner, but I figured Ricky debuts in episode three so I’ll blast that on my social media sometime in the next three weeks."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I don’t know. I’ll just say allegedly, maybe, I have a rat or two. You gotta wait and see the show to know what I’m talking about, but I do have a Ricky Rabies shirt that the crew graciously gave me, and I wear it proudly,” Punk stated. “I got some Ricky Rabies stickers too because Ricky was a big merch guy. He was selling stickers and t-shirts at intermission.”</p><p>Check out our full interview with CM Punk, where he also talks about the preparation he did for the role and some of the old-school inspirations for this character, at .
