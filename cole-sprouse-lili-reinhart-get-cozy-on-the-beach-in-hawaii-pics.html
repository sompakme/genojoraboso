Reinhart and Sprouse, who play on-again, off-again couple Betty and Jughead on The CW’s Riverdale, walked on the beach with their arms around each other in their bathing suits.
The duo have yet to confirm their relationship, but they sparked relationship rumors in July when Reinhart was seen wearing Sprouse’s jacket at Entertainment Weekly’s Comic-Con Bash in San Diego, Page Six reported at the time."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I love to talk about it,” Reinhart said in the magazine’s February 2018 issue. Mendes, 23, chimed in, “That’s something that we bonded about. I didn’t initially think you would be willing to talk about sex. And then once we started, I was like, ‘Oh, my God!’”</p><p>Reinhart continued,&nbsp;“I love to talk about it. It’s interesting — one big insecurity I had to get past was when the person I’m with has had more sexual experiences than I have and has been in love more than I have. It’s mainly sexual though — I find myself thinking that they’re comparing me to their ex-lovers. I know it’s a stupid insecurity, because I can’t control someone’s past or dictate who they slept with before me … and besides, they’re with me for a reason.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacp5yaerS80aisrJ1dobattYyrnKKmmJa%2FtXnGnqtmm5%2Bvxm67zWaroZ1dl7Kir8dmoKdlmJbEorXIZqeim6Nk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
