There's no shortage of such behavior, and there are many<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> big names that have found themselves linked to some pretty heinous crimes</a>. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Many have ended up behind bars,</a> and most of them seem to be able to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">carry on with their careers in spite of their criminal records.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alec-baldwin-s-prop-gun-gone-wrong>Alec Baldwin's Prop Gun Gone Wrong</h2><p>Perhaps among the most current incidents in the headlines today is that of Alec Baldwin and the tragedy on the set of the film Rust. At this time, Alec Baldwin has not been charged for this crime, nor is it clear if he's even responsible for it in any way, but he's definitely linked to this horrific tragedy, as he was the man&nbsp;holding the gun that ultimately took the life&nbsp;of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, and injured director Joel Souza. Baldwin insists he didn't pull the trigger, nor did he know there was a live round in the gun. The investigation is ongoing and so far, no charges have been laid.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Way To Prison? It looks Like Rapper Tory Lanez Might Be Headed Behind Bars After Criminal Charges</a></span></p><h2 id=tim-allen-s-drug-trafficking-arrest>Tim Allen's Drug Trafficking&nbsp;Arrest</h2><p>Tim Allen played the role of a fun-loving, quirky, family man on the hit sitcom Home Improvement. The show led the ratings in the 90s and portrayed Allen in a positive light. Most fans were unaware of the fact that prior to attaining fame, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he served two and a half years in jail </a>for drug trafficking. He served hard time before being released on parole, and most fans don't even realize he's a convicted felon.</p><h2 id=o-j-simpson-and-that-pesky-double-murder>O.J. Simpson And That Pesky Double Murder</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>O.J. Simpson is no longer recognized as being a significant athlete. Instead, fans are fixated on the fact that he was the prime suspect in the deaths of his ex-wife Nicole Simpson, and&nbsp;her friend, Ronald Goldman. The two were stabbed to death and O.J. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">narrowly escaped being convicted</a> of this double murder. Many feel that O.J. was in fact guilty, and watched in horror as he was famously acquitted of all charges. Interestingly, he went on to do a long prison sentence after being found guilty of involvement in a botched robbery case. He has since been released from prison.</p><h2 id=chris-brown-s-assault-and-probation-breach>Chris Brown's Assault And Probation Breach</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Millions of fans across the globe followed the headlines as images of Rihanna's badly beaten face were plastered all over every major publication. It was 2009 and the couple were scheduled to arrive to the Grammy awards, but they would never make it. Instead, Chris Brown was arrested for assault and battery and fans were horrified by the scene that was unfolding before them. Chris later served several months behind bars as a result of violating his probation orders.</p><h2 id=teresa-giudice-gets-caught-on-tax-evasion>Teresa Giudice Gets Caught On Tax Evasion</h2><p>The Real Housewives franchise is known to pack explosive drama into every episode, but fans got more than they expected when news came in that Real Housewives of New Jersey star Teresa Giudice and her husband at the time, Joe Giudice were both arrested. The couple was facing serious allegations of tax evasion, and fraud, and they each wound up behind bars in 2014, and Teresa was jailed for 11 months out of her 15 month sentence. Joe served time, and was also deported. The couple has since split.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mike-tyson-did-jail-time-for-rape>Mike Tyson Did Jail Time For Rape</h2><p>Mike Tyson doesn't want fans to remember that he was once convicted of rape and sentenced to three years in prison. This took place in the 1990s, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tyson still maintains his innocence </a>after all this time. However, a judge and jury felt he was guilty as charged, and he served the prison sentence that was forced upon him for the sexual assault on beauty pageant contestant&nbsp; Desiree Washington. She was just 18 years old at the time of the incident.</p><h2 id=tommy-lee-assaulted-pamela-anderson>Tommy Lee Assaulted Pamela Anderson</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tommy Lee and Pamela Anderson's relationship was as toxic as it gets. The two were crass and brazen with their public displays of affection, and didn't hesitate to share their raunchy rendezvous&nbsp;with anyone that would pay attention. However, things weren't just hot in the kitchen, the couple had a publicly embattled relationship that quickly became overly heated and eventually wound up being physically threatening. While holding her 7 week old baby, Anderson alleged that Lee attacked her, and he wound up in jail for 6 months for assault and battery.</p><h2 id=felicity-huffman-s-college-scandal>Felicity Huffman's College Scandal</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All mothers want the best possible outcomes for the future of their children, especially when it comes to their higher education. Very few are prepared to break the law for the opportunity though. Felicity Huffman, best known for her time on the Desperate Housewives, was<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> forced to learn this lesson the hard way.</a> She served a 14 day prison sentence for her role in the infamous college scandal, along with serving 250 hours of community service, and paying a $30,000 fine. Hiring someone to alter her daughters' grades was not worth the risk. Huffman's career and her overall image have both been irreversibly tainted.</p><h2 id=lil-kim-s-perjury-conviction>Lil Kim's Perjury Conviction</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lil Kim didn't fully think things through when she decided to testify in court to protect her friend and business manager, Damion Butler.&nbsp; He was facing charges surrounding a shootout which took place in front of a popular radio station. She took the stand and proceeded to lie to the grand jury by declaring that she hadn't seen him at that location on the day of the incident.&nbsp;She assumed that if she didn't confirm his presence, it would be hard for the judge to be convinced he was present at the scene of the crime. What she didn't realize, however, is that video footage would soon surface, which shows Damion opening the door for Kim on that date. She was sentenced to a year in jail for conspiracy and perjury, and will likely think twice before lying to defend her friends in the future.</p><h2 id=snoop-dogg-and-that-whole-gang-murder-thing>Snoop Dogg And That Whole Gang Murder Thing...</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Snoop Dogg was no stranger to the street life as a young man. He was heavily immersed in a prominent street gang and was involved in a variety of crimes that were associated with this lifestyle. However, an incident in 1993 nearly put his life on a very different path. He and a friend faced off against a rival gang, and as shots were exchanged, one of those men wound up murdered. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Snoop claimed self defense</a>, but the deceased man was not found to have had a weapon. After a grueling court case, it was revealed that friends of the deceased had removed his weapon from the crime scene, which corroborated Snoop's defense. In addition to this, the police mishandled the evidence, as well. Snoop narrowly evaded a murder conviction.</p><h2 id=mark-whalberg>Mark Whalberg</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mark Whalberg was the heart-throb known best for his musical talents and his involvement with the legendary boy band New Kids On The Block. What most fans didn't realize was that the young man they were idolizing had brutally attacked two different men, which led to<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> charges of attempted murder</a> being placed against him. He beat the men with such rage and aggression that one of the men was left blind in one eye. He eventually pled guilty to assault and wound up spending 45 days in jail.</p><h2 id=charlie-sheen>Charlie Sheen</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Charlie Sheen has been in and out of the courtroom more times than fans can count or follow. He seems to have a pattern of battery against women which is paired only to his use of illicit drugs and his dedication to paying for pleasure by hiring call girls on a continuous basis. He has been arrested a number of times, one of which was as a result of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his own father, Martin Sheen, phoning the authorities on him.</a> He was then forced into rehab as a form of intervention.</p><p>READ NEXT:</p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Reporter</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iHeart</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Biography</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">22 Words</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ranker</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGR%2Bc3nCnqOemqKewaqx0maroZmkYsSmvsRmnaitnpl6qMHIpauyZZ%2Bberi1y51knKqZorK0ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
