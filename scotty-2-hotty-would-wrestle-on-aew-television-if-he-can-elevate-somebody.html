A personal career highlight for me,” Scotty 2 Hotty&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a>.</p><p>Scotty 2 Hotty was a special guest on the latest episode of the <a href=#>AEW Unrestricted podcast</a>. During the interview, he mentioned that he would love to wrestle on TV but only if he can elevate another star.</p><p>“I mean, you know, it was talked about, right? The idea is exciting to me, I just want it to be for the right reason, I want it to be for the right thing.</p><p>“I want to elevate somebody, I want to elevate the show, create a moment, I don’t want it to just be a cold match if we do it. I don’t want to just go out there and have a match. It has to be the right thing. My first job here is to be a coach and producer; I don’t want to split my time doing both. I feel like it hurts my job as a producer,” Scotty 2 Hotty said.
