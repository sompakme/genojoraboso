People have expectations of you from an early age. As such, the privacy and the careless childhood often turn into a constant camera chase. With that said, some children are just skilful at maintaining this kind of lifestyle thanks to their upbringing. One of them is Sophia Abraham, the daughter of Farrah Abraham.</p><p>Farrah is a television personality who participated in all seasons of 16 and Pregnant. Also, she appeared in the MTV series Teen Mom and Teen Mom OG with her mother. This exposure helped the girl build anticipation on her upcoming child. She gave birth to her daughter, Sophia, in 2009 in Los Angeles, California. The girl celebrates her birthday on the 23rd of February under the Pisces constellation family. Her birth name is Sophia Laurent Abraham.</p><h3><span id=Sophia_Laurent_Father><strong>Sophia Laurent Father</strong></span></h3><p>Laurent is the <strong>biological daughter of Derek Underwood</strong>. Sadly, the guy is no longer with us as he got killed in a car accident on the 28th of December, 2008. He died at an early age of eighteen, just two months before the birth of his daughter. Farah and Derek had parted ways when she found out about her pregnancy at the age of sixteen. Throughout her participation in TV shows, Derek never appeared, but he could be heard during phone conversations.</p><p>Sophia has shown signs of a celebrity from her early days. She works as a child model, social media personality, actress, and owner of a children’s boutique. Yes, you heard it right. The girl, despite her young age, is an entrepreneur in the process. We already know about her mother, but who is her father?</p><h3><span id=Sophia_Laurent_Instagram_Twitter_Eyes_Hair_Measurements><strong>Sophia Laurent Instagram, Twitter, Eyes, Hair, & Measurements</strong></span></h3><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.webofbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sophia-laurent-wiki.jpg alt="Sophia Laurent Wiki" width=750 height=750 sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Sophia is just 14 years old and has tasted the initial success of her career. She is famous, considering she has not stepped into her teens. The girl appeared on all the seasons of Teen Mom alongside her mother until the series ended in 2012. After that, she landed her spot on her mother’s music video called “Blowin” which has amassed 2.5 million views to this day. The little lady became the face of her mother’s NY Times Best Seller “My Teenage Dream Ended”.</p><p>With such popularity and constant exposure to the media world, it didn’t surprise us when the budding star exploded on social media. As per current statistics, Sophia has 667 thousand followers on her Instagram page and around 18.2 thousand subscribers on YouTube. Not too shabby for a teenager, right? Talking about her aesthetics, the girl has inherited good genetics from her parents.</p><p>Like her mother, Laurent has brown eyes and brown hair. The combo enhances her beauty, as seen from her pictures. She is at a growing age, but currently stands at the height of 3 feet and 8 inches and maintains a healthy weight of 27 kg.</p><h3><span id=How_Much_Is_Sophia_Laurents_Net_Worth><strong>How Much Is Sophia Laurent’s Net Worth?</strong></span></h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.webofbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sophia-laurent-net-worth.jpg alt="Sophia Laurent Net Worth" width=750 height=750 sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Sophia is on her way to a wealthier and famous lifestyle. She is 14 years old, but her career path is evident as an early morning dewdrop. With the help of her mother, little Laurent runs a children’s boutique shop. The girl is too young to handle her finances, so she depends on her mother.</p><p>On the other hand, her guardian, Farrah, has a successful career. We have already discussed her multiple appearances on Television shows. In addition to this, she adds her revenues to her secondary professions like singing and writing. Her involvement with the hit MTV show 16 and Pregnant reportedly granted her around $30,000, as per authentic sources. All this has blessed Farrah with an estimated net worth of $1 million.</p><p>What’s more? Sophia holds endorsement deals with several companies. I mean, the girl is putting several adults to shame with her work ethic. She got featured on the cover of Playboy, OK! Magazine. To this day, she has contributed to brands like hotmiamistyles, Daily Mail Femail, Pokemon, PrettyLittleThing, and many others. Also, her YouTube channel helps her to take home an amount of $150-$2.4 thousand on an annual basis.</p><p>Returning to Sophia, the girl is also a member of shows like Celebrity Big Brother, Couples Therapy, and Million Dollar Matchmaker. These are sure to add up to her annual revenue. Expanding her business goals, she launched a frozen yoghurt shop, a toy store, and a kid’s clothing store with the help of her mother.
