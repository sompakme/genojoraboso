The salaries fluctuate based on who has more screen time, but it’s been <a href=#>reported that some of them make a million per season</a>. So, it’s likely that Caitlyn is getting a decent pay check for the new docuseries.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Caitlyn has previously expressed regret for not being included</a> in the family’s ongoing Hulu reality show The Kardashians. The Olympic athlete stopped appearing on Keeping Up with the Kardashians in 2019 following comments she made about Kris Jenner in her memoir.</p><p>"I was there when this started from day one. I watched it grow. And doing the show for almost 20 seasons was one of the highlights of my life," Caitlyn tweeted last year ahead of the Hulu show’s debut. "To be able to work with my family for all those years, connect with the fans, it was incredible. Happy that it continues for my family."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Debuting in 2007, KUWTK saw its premiere, and in September 2020, the family made public their decision to conclude the show. Merely three months later, the family entered into a multi-year agreement aimed at "developing worldwide content," set to be exclusively streamed on Hulu within the United States and across various international regions.</p><p>“House of Kardashian” is only the latest television program from the famous family, and given their past success, it’s bound to be a hit amongst fans, too, especially since the family is bringing Caitlyn back.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kim Zolciak & Daughter Brielle Sued Over Massive Unpaid Credit Card Bills</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Digital Spy</a>, <a href=#>Style Caster</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSworXTpbCnZZqau6%2Bx0Wapnq2ensGmv4ywoK2gXaCus7DArJ%2BimZ5is6K5yKWwZp6fp3qvsdZmm6ibpaiys7XErGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
