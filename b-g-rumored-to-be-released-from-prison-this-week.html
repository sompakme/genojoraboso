According to <a href=#>U.S. District Judge Susie Morgan</a>, she “did not find any gross neglect that affected the outcome” of the 42-year-old’s motion.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Birdman also penned a letter in an attempt to convince the judge that B.G. could have a positive impact on society and had been rehabilitated during his prison term. “He is not only a generational artist, but he’s got a platform and the chance to share his experience to better today’s young men who need to hear what he’s got to say,” the Cash Money Records founder wrote. “When he is released, I know he will give back and use what he’s gone through to help as many people as possible.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-72517946.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Last year, upon false rumors of B.G.’s release from prison, Gucci Mane offered the rapper a $1 million deal to sign with his label, 1017 Records. “My 1017 family help me welcome home the living legend @BGHollyHood!” Guwop wrote in the now-deleted tweet. “Glad u home bruh!
