This time around, the hater referenced Gomez’s ex <a href=#><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></a>, writing, “Selena really went from Justin to @theaarondominguez. We love to see the downgrade.”</p><p>Dominguez continued to remain unbothered as he replied in a since-deleted post, “Good morning.

The 10-episode show, which also stars <a href=#><strong>Steve Martin</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Martin Short</strong></a>, follows a trio of strangers who share an interest in true crime and end up joining forces to solve a murder that occurred in their Manhattan apartment building.</p><p>Dominguez plays a character named Oscar and Gomez portrays Mabel.

Before that, Selenators speculated in August that she was dating her longtime friend <strong>Dylan O’Brien</strong>. Around that time, Gomez revealed on <a href=#>her Selena + Chef series</a> that she was talking to a “cute boy” and fans surmised that the mystery man could be the 29-year-old Teen Wolf alum due to their social media interactions.</p><p>Gomez’s <a href=#>last high-profile relationship</a> was with <a href=#><strong>The Weeknd</strong></a>, <a href=#>whom she split from in October 2017</a> after 10 months.
