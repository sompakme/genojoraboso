We look at them to see how we should dress, where we should travel, and of course what to eat. We are completely and utterly obsessed with celebrities and our generation can't deny that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only do celebrities have the best meal plans but they also have access to some of the most incredible trainers in the world. This is why, if you think about it, celebrities are probably very educated in that department and would probably be amazing personal trainers. A trainer does not only need to be in good shape but they need to have a quality that would inspire and motivate people as well as make them feel like they are in a non-judgemental environment.</p><p>When you think about celebrities who you would love to have as a trainer you can't just look at their body. You need to check their work ethic and motivation level when it comes to being healthy. That's why we thought it would be fun to come up with a list of celebrities who would make amazing personal trainers. From classic beauty to trendy reality stars, this list is jam-packed with hot celebrities who we would both love to train with and love to look like.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hugh-jackman><strong>Hugh Jackman</strong></h2><p>When it comes to good-looking men, <a href=#>Hugh Jackman</a> is on almost every woman's list. He is tall, dark, handsome, and Australian what more can a girl ask for?</p><p>Jackman is one of those actors who is able to mold his body into whatever he thinks it could be and that is the reason why he always looks so damn good.</p><p>This gorgeous man is a no bullsh*t kind of person and once said,</p><p><strong>“There comes a certain point in life when you have to stop blaming other people for how you feel or the misfortunes in your life. You can’t go through life obsessing about what might have been."</strong></p><p>This is the kind of mentality you want from a trainer. This is one man who would definitely be able to whip anyone into shape. Besides, who in their right mind would ever bother turning down the Wolverine? There are some things in life too good to ever pass up.</p><h2 id=chris-hemsworth><strong>Chris Hemsworth</strong></h2><p>I could write for pages about why <a href=#>Chris Hemsworth</a> would be a great trainer, but I will try and keep it short.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hemsworth is a stallion, he is one of those people that just has an intensity in his eyes when he works out. He is the kind of person that eats to live not lives to eat and he has even said,</p><p><strong>“Eating when you're not hungry and taking in that amount of food is exhausting."</strong></p><p>I mean has he ever tried tacos...I'm guessing that answer is no! Hemsworth would be the kind of trainer that looks like an angel but trains you like an animal and that is exactly what a lot of people need.</p><p>Is he everything you could want in both eye candy and a trainer...are you really surprised he made this list?</p><h2 id=jessica-alba><strong>Jessica Alba</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Jessica Alba</a> is one of those women who just seems to be getting better with age.&nbsp;Her athletic build is probably her best feature and there is no denying that any woman would&nbsp;sell their soul to look like her, and that any man would do the same to be with her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alba is a smokeshow and to top it off she is a mother of three. What I would love to know is how she gets her body looking so good after having children three times...mind-blowing.</p><p>Alba has always had a positive attitude when it came to her body and she has been vocal about accepting your body for what it is.</p><p>In a previous interview, Alba stated: "Being perfect is being flawed, accepting it, and never letting it make you feel less than your best”, which is some amazing advice for women of all ages.</p><h2 id=jessica-biel><strong>Jessica Biel</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Jessica Biel</a> is known for having a killer body, she always has and something tells us she always will. Her incredible physique is exemplary of her active lifestyle.&nbsp;In a previous interview, the actress stated,</p><p><strong>"I like to do a couple of yoga classes during the week, mixed in with weight training sessions for strength. Yoga for me is more of an elongating thing. I hike and walk my dogs a lot. It keeps me very clear-headed."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I swear, if she had her own gym, I would travel across the country to be able to train by her side. Biel is fit, she is a perfect example that healthy is so much better than just being skinny. We're certain that her husband Justin Timberlake, is counting his blessings every day when he wakes up next to her.</p><h2 id=khloe-kardashian><strong>Khloe Kardashian</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Khloe Kardashian</a> has come a very long way when it comes to her fitness. Kardashian has inspired so many people throughout her fitness journey and there is no denying that a lot of people would jump at the opportunity to have her as a trainer.</p><p>Khloe Kardashian is now trying to inspire people, and motivates others with her new show Revenge Body, where she helps people struggling with their ideal body. She helps them not only gain control of their bodies but also has them feeling better about themselves.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kardashian is very open about her fitness journey and has gone on record saying, “When I started working out, it wasn't about weight loss; I was going through a really hard time and needed an emotional release. Once you start getting in the tabloids claiming you have fake body parts, then it's like, 'Okay, I made it. Now I'm really working out.”</p><h2 id=kourtney-kardashian><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></h2><p>This Kardashian is probably the most fit of them all. Kourtney has always loved working out and has said,</p><p>"Exercising is a part of my daily routine. So, even though I like to relax on vacation, getting a workout in is still important to me. Also, working out while traveling really helps me with jet lag and makes starting to work out again when I'm back at home not as difficult."</p><p>With that kind of mentality, there is no surprise that her body looks this good. Even after giving birth a few times it is almost like as if her body goes back and gets better and better which each child.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Kourtney Kardashian</a> is very deserving of this spot on our list and she is one of those people who you can't help but dream of having as a gym buddy.</p><h2 id=zac-efron><strong>Zac Efron</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Zac Efron</a> is a major babe, no other way around it.</p><p>When it comes to&nbsp;sick bodies that live at the gym, Zac Efron is up there with the best. His insane discipline is displayed in his ridiculously in shape body. For those of you who have not seen Baywatch, watch it and then you will know exactly why he is on this list.</p><p>Efron believes that working out is the best form of stress relief. He has stated,</p><p><strong>“Working out is my biggest hobby. It's my Zen hour. I just zone out.”</strong></p><p>Think about it ladies, would you not work a hundred times harder if you knew Zac Efron was watching every squat you did, and every move you made? His presence alone would be enough to motivate any girl in the world.</p><h2 id=jennifer-aniston><strong>Jennifer Aniston</strong></h2><p>The newly divorced&nbsp;<a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a> is without a doubt one of the most insanely hot women on the planet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aniston has always been known for having a banging body, she loves to hydrate herself, she loves working out and she tries to eat right as much as possible.</p><p>Aniston is a big supporter of self-love and she tries to influence women to be healthy rather than skinny. She wants women to feel okay about who they are.</p><p>"In my own brain, I've shifted my perspective, so who gives a sh*t! If you're going to walk out and have your belly is a little bloated, or you're not at the weight you want to be — you are perfect no matter what you are and no matter where you are and who cares," stated the actress.</p><h2 id=channing-tatum><strong>Channing Tatum</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Channing Tatum</a> is one of those people that seems like he was born in shape. The&nbsp;Hollywood actor grew up in a very athletic environment.</p><p>“In wrestling, there is no retreat. No way to slow things down. In wrestling, you advance and advance, and being tired is just a lie to make the other guy think he can relax. It's so hard - harder than anything I've ever done.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With his athletic background, I am sure that working out with him would make you sweat like nothing ever before. His intense personality, and of course, his staggering good looks would make the perfect combination to inspire us to get our bodies moving.&nbsp;The star of Step Up would really make you be the one to step up your fitness game.</p><h2 id=sofia-vergara><strong>Sofia Vergara</strong></h2><p>The 45-year-old bombshell is one of a kind. The mother, actress and beauty icon is one of those people that everyone finds attractive.</p><p><a href=#>Vergara</a> would make an amazing trainer because she is so full of life and personality.&nbsp;Watching her hit the gym would be more than inspiring, and as a bonus we can bet that she would be a laugh the whole way through.&nbsp;She is very dedicated to living an active lifestyle with her husband, the very fit and very handsome Joe Manganiello. Imagine having both of them train you? Now that would be a treat!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A lot of people are under the impression that Hollywood ladies do not pig out, but Vergara is different. She has even gone on record stating “My problem is desserts. I am obsessed with desserts." Even with her sugar obsession, she still puts most of us to shame.</p><h2 id=jennifer-lopez><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong></h2><p>You didn't think I was going to do this list and not include <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez </a>right?&nbsp;She has not aged since she hit the Hollywood scene and is known for being one of the most beautiful women on the planet.</p><p>Lopez loves working out and always has. She views her body as a temple, which really, is the way everyone should be treating it. You are what you eat and all that. Her workout routine and eating plan have allowed her to look phenomenal, so there is no doubt that if we were next to her, we would want to be just as fit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The reason why Lopez would be such a good trainer is&nbsp;because of her motivational personality. “You've got to love yourself first. You've got to be okay on your own before you can be okay with somebody else." This is the kind of compassion anyone would love.</p><h2 id=emily-ratajkowski><strong>Emily Ratajkowski</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Emily Ratajkowski</a> is one of&nbsp;Hollywood's newest it girls. Her features helped get her there, with her gorgeous face and her athletic body becoming a pair that everyone wanted to book for modelling.</p><p>Ratajkowski is one of those inspiring people who believe that everyone should embrace the body they have while trying to be the best version of themselves. The supermodel believes that,</p><p><strong>“Your body is your body; it's natural. Learn to love yourself for it”</strong></p><p>I could not agree more.&nbsp;She believes that eating right and working out is the only way to keep a perfect physique, and although she doesn't get to the gym as much as she would like to, something tells me she knows all the right exercises to get that burn going.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-lawrence><strong>Jennifer Lawrence</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Jennifer Lawrence</a> is without a doubt one of the best personalities on the planet, which is a big reason why she would be a good trainer, the time would just fly by.</p><p>She has had to get into crazy good shape for some of her films and by doing that I am sure she learned all the right tricks to get that body nice and toned. Lawrence has gone on record stating, “I’m never going to starve myself for a part . . . I don’t want little girls to be like, ‘Oh, I want to look like Katniss, so I’m going to skip dinner.’ That’s something I was really conscious of during training when you’re trying to get your body to look exactly right. I was trying to get my body to look fit and strong—not thin and underfed.”</p><p>She is inspirational in more ways than one and I am super obsessed with the person she is as well as her&nbsp;attitude to get into shape.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=queen-b><strong>Queen B</strong></h2><p>Bey&nbsp;has had the best trainers in the world for a majority of her life. Her body keeps on being insanely amazing no matter how many times she gets pregnant and gives birth. She slays all year round.</p><p><a href=#>Beyonce</a> knows what to do to get her body in the best shape, especially when she goes on tour. However, like everyone else, she has her vices.</p><p><strong>"I love my butter pecan ice cream, but I also love to work out. We all have our issues. Mine is arms and legs, keeping them tight and toned. It takes work, believes me" said the superstar.</strong></p><p>Beyonce would not only make the best trainer because of her incredible discipline and work technique but she can also sing to you while you squat, which would be pretty epic. Besides, why wouldn't you take her up on it? You've seen how intense her body is on stage, and she doesn't get that body by sitting down.</p><h2 id=harley-quinn><strong>Harley Quinn</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Margot Robbie </a>is not just another skinny actress, she is strong as hell and that is probably the biggest reason why she is on this list. She has even stated the following in a previous interview,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“To do all your own stunts, you have to be so strong.”</strong></p><p>Robbie loves working out and she is in incredible shape. Her entire body is toned, and lined with muscle. She seriously looks like she could be cast as any superhero (or villain, which she has done) and kick some major butt.</p><p>Another thing about Margot Robbie that would make her a good trainer is that she seems like a sweet person who would care about her clients, which is an important quality for a trainer to have.</p><p>If you want to know one of her secret workout weapons, its jump rope....you're welcome! And hey, don't judge too quickly on that, it's not as easy as you think it is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhpZWK%2FqrzPnptmm5WhsqO%2ByK2gnqtdrLJuw86uo51lp5a7tXnArGSpnaKovK%2Bty2arq5mZo7Kzv44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
