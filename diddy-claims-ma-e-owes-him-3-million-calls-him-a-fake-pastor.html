Anybody can come and step up. Bring your receipts. But I’m not playing. I’m back outside, and I’m fighting back for us. And I’m also doing some fighting back for me.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Puff glanced around the iHeartRadio studio as he continued clearing his name. Then, stoically, the businessman, legally known as Sean Combs, 52, claimed he “never jerked anybody,” and that Ma$e actually owes him a pretty penny.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Ma$e <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>owes me $3 million</a>,” Diddy said. “That’s facts, I got the receipts.” Diddy persisted, “And I’m not gon’ go back-and-forth with Ma$e. I’m not going back-and-forth with nobody. I’m just gonna speak up for myself now. Anybody that thinks I owe them something, show me the receipt and you’ll get paid within 24 hours.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Elsewhere in the interview, the mogul addressed his son Christian King Combs embarking on his musical journey with the Bad Boy name. However, he emphasized that he wanted his son to “make it on his own.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“He said he wanted to be a rapper, and I said he had to do it on his own,” P. Diddy expressed. “He found his own distribution, he started grinding, and everybody thought I was helping him. They were making him work for what he had just accomplished. He got an undeniable record with Kodak Black. And I’m so proud of him because I had nothing to do with it.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Shortly after, Diddy warned his son, playfully telling him he “will not outbop” him.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I’m training extra hard, he will not be outbopping me,” he jokingly said. “He’s in the lead right now, and he’s going to kill the BET awards, y’all gon be saying, ‘Puff, you can retire now,’ I’m proud of that, but I’m not going nowhere.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Charlamagne stayed on the topic of the 2022 BET Hip-Hop Awards, asking Diddy about the two-way tie between two Revolt properties —&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Caresha Please</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;Drink Champs — for Podcast of the Year.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I didn’t pay for that. It was the best Podcast of the Year!,” he rebutted The Breakfast Club host. “Don’t be mad at me <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>because I’m a winner</a>.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Watch the full interview below.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5m2pbDYZqqlmZ2oeq6t0p5km6qVlrinrdKtZJykpZd6cn6SbW1ycWBnfnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
