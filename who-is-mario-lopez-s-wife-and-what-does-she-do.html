As a result, it would make no sense at all if most TV shows and movies didn’t feature any young characters. Still, it is a real shame that so many movies and TV shows employ child stars. After all, it has become common knowledge that <a href=#>a lot of former child stars go on to struggle a lot</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the bright side, there are some former child and teen actors who go on to lead lives that seem to be largely positive from the outside looking in. For example, Mario Lopez has seemingly crafted a really good life for himself and his entire family. One of the main reasons for that is that just like Lopez’s co-star <a href=#>Mark-Paul Gosselaar who seems to have found the perfect wife for him</a>, it appears like Mario’s longtime partner makes him very happy. Of course, that begs an obvious question, who is Mario Lopez’s wife and what does she do?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Saved By The Bell': What Is Mark-Paul Gosselaar's Net Worth?</a></span></p><h2 id=fascinating-beginnings>Fascinating Beginnings</h2><p>In romantic comedies, the best couples tend to have meet-cutes which means that they come across one another for the first time in some kind of adorable way. When it comes to this couple, the story of <a href=#>how Mario Lopez and Courtney Mazza met</a> sounds like something out of a romantic comedy even though it resulted in some negative side effects.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2008, Mario Lopez was in New York working on a Broadway production of “The Chorus Line” when he crossed paths with Courtney Mazza who was also a part of the show. On the bright side, it is clear that Lopez and Mazza shared a great deal of chemistry after they got to know one another as it wouldn’t take long for them to become a couple. However, the unfortunate aspect of the story is that when Lopez met Mazza, he reportedly was dating the famous Dancing with the Star performer Karina Smirnoff.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, there have been countless romantic comedies in which the lead is with the wrong person when they meet the love of their life. In reality, however, that situation is very painful for the person who has their significant other break up with them for someone new. After Mario Lopez broke things off with Karina Smirnoff, he finally asked Mazza out but he ran late for their first date so Courtney “blew him off”. Of course, the couple eventually rescheduled their first date and the rest is history.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Mario Lopez Went From Making $3,500 Per 'Saved By The Bell' Episode To A $25 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=the-happy-couple>The Happy Couple</h2><p>After Mario Lopez and Courtney Mazza became a couple, their busy schedules forced them to have a long-distance relationship at first. Once both of them realized how taxing making things work from afar can be, Lopez asked Mazza to move in with him on a trial basis and according to her, he made his place feel like their home from the start.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After moving in together, Mario Lopez and Courtney Mazza went on to get married in 2012 and their nuptials were filmed for a TLC special titled Mario And Courtney’s Wedding Fiesta. After their marriage, Courtney took Mario’s last name and throughout their relationship, the Lopez family has grown a lot. After all, Mario and Courtney have a daughter who was born in 2010 and their two sons entered the world in 2013 and 2019. From all accounts, the Lopez family is close-knit and extraordinarily happy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When talking about his relationship with his wife, Mario Lopez has said that he is lucky he got involved with Courtney Mazza when he did because he would have screwed things up earlier in his life. Considering that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lopez infamously cheated on his first wife which resulted in their marriage getting annulled</a> after just two weeks, it certainly seems like he is right about that statement. With that in mind, it is wonderful that Mario and Courtney met at the right moment in their lives.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here’s Why Mario Lopez And Ali Landry Divorced After 2 Weeks</a></span></p><h2 id=an-impressive-career>An Impressive Career</h2><p>Given the fact that Mario Lopez has been famous for decades at this point, it makes a certain level of sense that a lot of people know Courtney Lopez as his wife first and foremost. While is seems abundantly clear that Courtney is overjoyed to be Mario’s wife, it is still a shame that a lot of people don’t realize that she is quite the accomplished person in her own right.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During Courtney Lopez’s life, she has worked as a dancer, actor, producer, radio host, and “reality” show star. In terms of Courtney’s “reality” show credentials, she starred in the aforementioned show that chronicled her wedding and another series titled Mario Lopez: Saved by the Baby. Courtney’s radio career also is closely associated with her husband as she and Mario have co-hosted a show together. As an actor, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Courtney Lopez has popped up in several shows and movies</a>. For example, Courtney landed roles in shows like The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia, and the Saved by the Bell reboot among others.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Fans Think Mario Lopez And Wife Courtney Are Couple Goals</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuucCroKhlnKS9psbSZq6inpVirq%2BwjLCfmqxdmbymv4ysn55llKR8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
