Simon Cowell and Carmen Electra</b></h2><p>X Factor creator and judge, <a href=#>Simon Cowell</a><a href=#>confirmed</a> that he was dating model, <a href=#>Carmen Electra</a> in December of 2012. Cowell had made it clear in an interview with <a title="Ryan Seacrest Net Worth" href=#>Ryan Seacrest</a> that Electra was not his "girlfriend," but rather a person he was dating. Although Cowell did mention that he found Electra to be adorable. Electra only had nice things to say about Cowell as well, stating that "He's so cute. He is adorable. He's actually a sweetheart." The two first met on the show Britain's Got Talent. They only lasted a couple of months together as they broke it off in February of 2013.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=10-pamela-anderson-and-michael-jackson><b>10. Pamela Anderson and Michael Jackson</b></h2><p>In 2008, rumors swirled around that&nbsp;<a href=#>Michael Jackson</a>&nbsp;was dating&nbsp;<a href=#>Pamela Anderson</a> and it turns out it was all true. The two were said to have gone on a few dates that were highly private and fully arranged by Jackson's network of people. It was stated that the couple went on their first date at the Shutters Hotel in Malibu, where they had drinks as they talked privately in the corner of the bar. There were reports that the two hit it off very well, which is why they ended up on the second date, going for coffee in Malibu. However, it appears that nothing more transpired between the two.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-moby-and-natalie-portman><b>9. Moby and Natalie Portman</b></h2><p>Electronic musician, <a href=#>Moby</a> gave hope to people everywhere when it was announced that he was dating the beautiful actress, <a href=#>Natalie Portman</a>&nbsp;back in 2001.

The two have remained close, as Norton is Love's daughter, Francis Bean's godfather. However in 2010, Love ranted on Twitter how Norton allegedly made her lose $300,000 in an investment gone wrong. Since then, Love has apologized for the accusations and has called Norton "nothing but a good force."</p><p></p><h2 id=7-lyle-lovett-and-julia-roberts><b>7.

Their entire relationship appeared odd to the world, from their wedding that was planned in a matter of 72 hours to their living in separate residences despite being married. Roberts had even <a href=#>stated</a> how it was "a little difficult to go from spending time together to not spending time together." Thus it was no surprise to anyone when the couple announced they were splitting up after 21 months of marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=6-lucy-liu-and-george-clooney><b>6.
