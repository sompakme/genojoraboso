However, that was not always the case. Many of her fans remember a time when Cyrus was a simple girl from Tennessee who managed to get her dream job with Disney Channel and become a name people knew all around the world. Miley truly changed the game for Disney, that's for certain.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Disney broke their 4 season rule with Hannah Montana only due to the fact that the show was bringing in massive ratings, with Cyrus' music seeing huge revenue for the company too. Overall, the show would last from 2006-2011, reaching around 100 episodes for her role as the title character. She would become immensely famous from her time with the Mickey Mouse organization, which many thought she would use to help afterward.</p><p>She did not exactly use it right away. She would land roles in movies like LOL, The Last Song, and So Undercover. She would also see some other television time, Two and a Half Men for a few episodes. However, with both television and movies not being exactly lucrative for Miley Cyrus, many felt her Disney time was the end of her. That was until her music started to take off.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>No longer restricted by the Disney rules, she could not only write music that was more adult or teen-centered, but she could also perform it this way too. That led to multiple singles like "Wrecking Ball," "We Can't Stop," and many more to also provide relatively scandalous videos to accompany the songs. This change in attitude and appearance led to several doors opening for Miley that were not even available previously. It also boosted her popularity. Yet in spite of this, people have advocated for Miley to be pretty much removed from radio, television, and movies in the past.</p><p>The real question is, would Hollywood or the music industry within it actually get rid of Miley Cyrus? We feel the answer to this is a clear no. That said, we decided to provide a reason for our feeling. In fact, we decided to offer 15 reasons for it. We're thorough like that. Please enjoy our article on the 15 reasons Hollywood will never get rid of Miley Cyrus, no matter how crazy she gets.</p><h2 id=crazy-is-not-exactly-the-word><strong>Crazy Is Not Exactly The Word</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Miley Cyrus, to some, has come across a bit nuts...she is not actually some crazy person meant for the nearest institution. Everything she does is for a reason usually. While smoking on a stage somewhere is not necessarily for a purpose to some, think about what message it sends. Miley smoked the stuff enough to know she could wait for a few minutes to leave and go to the back and do it. She could have done it before going there or even after. She didn't.</p><p>The message she was sending was that she is grown up and not the Disney princess she was made out to be years prior. While acting certain ways will make you believe this, she has to sell this in other ways as well. While not the best idea of things, it was a push to the world that she isn't that girl from before.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That is also why she changed her hair color, chopped most of it off, and even danced&nbsp;provocatively at the MTV Video Music Awards. Was any of this needed for her to prove herself as a grown up? Possibly not. However, did you automatically see Miley as the grown-up girl she wanted you to see her as upon the conclusion of these acts? You better believe it. She went into a wild frenzy here, only to prove something. It may not have been the best way to do it, but you cannot argue its effectiveness.</p><h2 id=you-cannot-ignore-the-talent-right><strong>You Cannot Ignore The Talent, Right?</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While Miley Cyrus might be a lot to handle, can we really ignore the talent she has? Miley Cyrus has been a notable singer for some time. She is the daughter of popular country singer Billy Ray Cyrus, so music genes were always there. She even has a sister, Noah, who has had some pretty big hits as of late too. Due to her talent, even if she never made it to Disney, she would likely have been given a shot as a music artist due to her singing alone. This made her a really useful talent to Disney, who loves their actors/actresses to be singers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Miley was able to join up with Hannah Montana where she sang consistently as a literal singer on the show. A girl who lived a double life of a normal school-going girl who sang for thousands on the weekends, wearing a wig and lots of make-up. The show obviously made her famous, but her talent helped to keep her fame. She has won awards for her music as well. She currently has 2 Billboard Music Awards as well as a Billboard Touring Award. She has also been nominated for two American Music Awards and a Grammy Award on top of it. Only the best can get into this sort of thing.</p><h2 id=hollywood-loves-the-beautiful><strong>Hollywood Loves The Beautiful</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Miley Cyrus is known for her talent, but her looks are also highly noted. In the South, looking gorgeous is just as important as it is anywhere else in the country. Women are taught to always look good so that you can land a great man. Though this is not ultimately how things should be, it's still taught somewhat. Due to this situation, Miley Cyrus was always going to be looking to come off as someone that looked good. The thing is, she's naturally a beautiful girl.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She often posts on social media without make-up as a way to show how natural beauty is important. While she wears make-up too, the fact that she does not have to do it as much as others might have to is pretty big. Hollywood, while vain, loves people like this. Movie stars are often good-looking, with even television stars joining them in this area. It's a big deal to them, as they have to sell people to the rest of the world. It's much easier to do that, psychologically, when someone is appealing to people. With Miley being someone in that category, she'll always be someone that Hollywood considers as "one of them" at the end of the day. In part, due to the looks.</p><h2 id=being-funny-is-very-important><strong>Being Funny Is Very Important</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While some will believe that humor is useless to society, most others believe otherwise. There's a popular saying that claims "laughter is the best medicine." The reason for this is due to how we feel when we laugh. The happiest people are the ones that can do this a lot. So it is not a bad thing to be someone who can make others laugh. Miley Cyrus is known for being very good at this. She was mostly known for her comedic work while being on the Disney Channel.</p><p>However, Miley ultimately got the job on Hannah Montana because she impressed casting directors with her personality. She came off as a likeable and funny girl that had talent on top of it. This worked very well for her. Today, she's considered to be a great interview and talk show guest dream. She's usually always hilarious when used in these areas because of the personality she possesses. While she is not always hilarious, she tries to mostly make people laugh when possible. When one is naturally funny, it's not as if she always tries to be that way. However, she typically always can be and that is something Hollywood enjoys.</p><h2 id=she-happens-to-be-the-god-daughter-of-dolly-parton><strong>She Happens To Be The God-Daughter Of Dolly Parton</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One thing often never spoken about is how close Miley Cyrus and Dolly Parton are. Dolly and Miley's father Billy Ray are good friends and have been for years. They still are, and upon her birth, Dolly became Miley's God-Mother. In that, if something were to ever happen to Billy Ray and Miley's mom, Dolly would be the one they chose to take care of Miley. Dolly and Miley are still close to this day, and she even appeared on Hannah&nbsp;Montana with Miley a few times.</p><p>Due to this closeness, even if Miley never made it to Disney, she likely would have always remained in the spotlight. With Dolly and her father both being music stars, it would be crazy to assume otherwise. Hollywood loves Dolly, as does the world of country music. The woman even has her own theme park in Tennessee for crying out loud! With Dolly being there for Miley, it's pretty clear Hollywood would know about Cyrus. On top of this, she could always be a plus-one to anything in Hollywood. Miley would never be removed completely from the scene. That Dolly connection is a pretty powerful one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=being-a-women-s-rights-supporter-puts-you-in-a-good-light><strong>Being A Women's Rights Supporter Puts You In A Good Light</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With all of the horrible allegations and proven issues against several Hollywood men, there is never a bigger time in the world of Hollywood for a feminist. However, there's also never been a better time to push Women's Rights completely. Miley Cyrus has been a heavily used person with multiple Women's Rights movements.</p><p>Miley wanted to push the idea of female empowerment through something like social media, despite it showing part of a female body to the public. She has supported several other movements for women. One other prominent one being equal rights, in that, if one does the same job as a man in every way, they should get paid as much for it. Not only is this a fair idea, but one that should not even be worth a debate. Hollywood is pushing the female movement in a big way today, so Miley's well-known Women's Rights messages and campaigns are likely something Hollywood knows a good bit about.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-not-really-in-trouble-with-the-law-at-all><strong>She's Not Really In Trouble With The Law At All</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While Miley Cyrus is seen as a crazy and wild-type, have you ever noticed that she's mostly in the news for videos and photos only? She tends to appear without clothing a lot and this is relatively controversial. Yet none of this is breaking the law really. In fact, breaking the law is something Miley Cyrus has been pretty good at avoiding her entire career.</p><p>While Cyrus is known for her very interesting ways, it is very noteworthy to point this out about her. With so many musical artists and actors that have been involved in breaking the law, one would assume Miley would be praised for not being one of them. There are multiple actors and musical artists who are still doing what they love despite horrible actions. Some of which have gone on to have great success even after their issues with the law or incidents they were involved with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Look at Chris Brown alone for this. Many thought his career was over in 2009. It was something that offended everyone, with many people rightfully being outraged when pictures of Rihanna's face made it to the internet. Yet in 2011 and 2012 he would be nominated for Grammy Awards and he would be nominated for an AMA Award in 2010, 2011, and 2012. If Brown can get away with it, one would assume Miley should be fine while avoiding such law-breaking controversy. It would be quite hypocritical of the music industry alone to blacklist her after forgiving Brown.</p><h2 id=she-feels-being-unafraid-to-be-you-is-powerful><strong>She Feels Being Unafraid To Be You Is Powerful</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Despite all that has been said about Miley Cyrus the last number of years, one thing has been consistent. She has not been afraid to be herself. Ever since her time with Disney, she has been open about being herself and supporting others for doing the same. It's pretty hard to not be fake in the world of Hollywood. This is especially hard for women, as paparazzi follow people around and hope to catch them at the most inopportune time. For women, this can be a nightmare to deal with on a regular basis.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just imagine being famous and followed all the time. Imagine all you do in a given day or off and on, and think about the issue of what could occur being followed around. They could catch you on a bad day, you could not be wearing make-up, your hair may be a mess, etc. For men, this is not nearly as hard to deal with. Meanwhile, for women, everything is judged in La La Land. When you deal with this so often, it can really be jarring to accept being like a normal person.</p><p>Yet despite this, she is often seen in public being herself. She is not afraid to not be perfect. A lot of musical artists and actors feel they have to be. Women especially, considering all that is asked of them. From keeping a certain figure, having certain hair, having certain make-up, wearing certain clothes, etc. Miley says to forget all this, be you. While Hollywood was likely not accepting of this in the past, they are today. With the female movement, people like Miley will be beloved far more for being like this than they used to be.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=miley-founded-the-happy-hippie-foundation><strong>Miley Founded The Happy Hippie Foundation</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Miley Cyrus is overlooked for her philanthropy far more than she should be. She actually had her own way to raise money for people with what she calls the Happy Hippie Foundation. She would be inspired to start it after a young&nbsp;transitioned person named Leelah Alcorn took her own life. The foundation would be started by Miley in 2014 and has become a massive thing today, 4 years later. The focus of the foundation is actually quite interesting.</p><p>Miley wanted to focus on homeless youth, especially concerning those in the minority communities. These people have a high homeless rate, which Miley did not realize before. This led her to make the foundation, in order to help these people with a place to live. However, it was not only focusing on this community. She realized there were other vulnerable communities that needed help too. The focus was primarily on youth homelessness, which the foundation has managed to help cut down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Beyond this, they have helped raise money for various students. From November of 2016 to February 2017 alone, they were able to raise enough money to help 10,000 students across 60 schools in the United States. What the foundation has done the last few years is quite amazing. Clearly in a world, as divided as today's, Hollywood would enjoy seeing someone do a kind thing for numerous people. It only makes them look better when you think about it.</p><h2 id=she-is-accepting-of-people-s-differences><strong>She Is Accepting Of People's Differences</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With a foundation like the one mentioned before, it's pretty clear Miley Cyrus is the kind of person that accepts people for who they are. Miley would come out&nbsp;in 2016 to her mother as someone who is not limited by a person's gender or gender identity. Miley's acceptance in herself made her want to accept others for who they are as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Miley's acceptance went back for years. She grew up in a Christian family and was taught under these morals and beliefs. Yet during all of that, she never judged someone for their orientation. She told PEOPLE in 2016: "I saw one human in particular who didn't identify as male or female. Looking at them, they were both: beautiful and tough but vulnerable and feminine but masculine. And I related to that person more than I related to anyone in my life."</p><p>With someone like this around, being one to never judge others for how they feel, it's refreshing. With this being out there, Miley has developed a cult-like following from the community. This only serves to make her popularity drive Hollywood's need to keep her around.</p><h2 id=she-s-still-a-small-town-tennessee-girl-at-heart><strong>She's Still A Small Town Tennessee Girl At Heart</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Miley Cyrus may have made it big in Hollywood, and she may have been all over the world, but despite being in these areas, she's still someone from a small town in Tennessee. Miley grew up in the southern state and found herself involved in multiple things many southern girls ends up doing. She loves animals and people alike. She grew up with tons of space to enjoy the life of a girl from this area. The simplicity of growing up here and everything making sense, without much need for argument is lovely. Today, there are so many loaded things that can ultimately make things difficult to manage.</p><p>Miley puts an end to all of this, with her simple way of looking at things like many seem to do. To her, growing up in these areas, the idea of things being less complicated made sense. It was what made her the way she is today. The girl who accepts others because it's the right thing to do. The girl who helps others, because it's the right thing to do. The girl that has a major personality, and is kind to all she meets. Something that, of course, is the right thing to be. Hollywood tries to make things more complicated than they need to be. Making it simple again ultimately makes things better. Miley clearly represents this ideology well. Why would Hollywood want to get rid of her now?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-known-to-be-easy-to-work-with><strong>She's Known To Be Easy To Work With</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When first arriving at Disney, she did not quite get along with Emily Osment. The two had to be best friends on the show, but in real life, the two were at each other's throats. Eventually, things settled down and the two became very good friends, just as their characters were on Hannah Montana. Interestingly, this is the only real controversy she went through with another star from the movie or television industry. She is also known to be wonderful to work within the music world.</p><p>While like all artists, she likes having things done a certain way when it comes to her work, she isn't going over the top with it. Her issues with Emily were likely a problem because of issues in her transition from her small town roots to the glamor of Hollywood. When things settled down, and she knew how to operate, things worked out. Obviously, when you think about Miley today, you think of her solo career. However, she has collaborated with many artists. On top of this, she has been used in various skits for places like The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and Saturday Night Live.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Throughout all of this, everyone she worked with reported her to be a sweetheart that was fun to work with. This does not happen with people in the business if they do not like you. They avoid positive talk on you and choose not to work with you further. Usually, opportunities start to slowly die off because of this. For Miley, they have continued to come through. This is something Hollywood clearly loves.</p><h2 id=she-has-donated-loads-of-money-to-charity><strong>She Has Donated Loads Of Money To Charity</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While we discussed Miley's foundation already, this does not somehow end her philanthropy work. Before her foundation and even afterward, she continued to work with or donate money to many charities. Her foundation has worked with The Trevor Project among many others. She's also been useful in social media campaigns to raise money for multiple things. She's a&nbsp;known supporter of the City of Hope National Medical Center in California and has done benefit concerts there in 2008, 2009, and 2012.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In February of 2010, she donated several items to help raise money for victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. This included the dress she wore to the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards and two tickets to the Hollywood premiere of her movie <i>The Last Song.&nbsp;</i>In August of 2017, she wanted to help people affected by Hurricane Harvey. This led her to donate a massive sum of $500,000 to help. She helped to raise $200,000 for charity My Friend's Place in 2014 as well. This is on top of her foundation that we mentioned earlier. Miley is of course very successful from her time with Disney and her music career now. She's won awards due to her abilities here. (looktothestars.com)</p><p>However, to be someone who donates whenever possible, to be someone who opens a huge foundation with a massive mission that is obviously quite expensive....that's impressively kind. Hollywood clearly needs more people who are willing to do this kind of thing. While many Hollywood types have been involved with charities. Very few seem to be as involved as Miley, which is a testament to the person and beyond the woman on the stage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-does-not-go-from-guy-to-guy-in-a-swift-fashion><strong>She Does Not Go From Guy To Guy In A Swift Fashion</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Miley Cyrus may be known as someone who is overly&nbsp;provocative&nbsp;from her time at the MTV Video Music Awards years ago to her removing of clothing for various photos and music videos. However, she is not someone known for going from guy to guy. It's quite interesting to consider too. Taylor Swift is from the same state, grew up the same way as Miley did....just without the famous parent stuff. Both are now in the pop singer game and have both been successful in their musical careers. Yet Taylor made a career doing songs about her ex-boyfriends.</p><p>Seriously, Taylor Swift is somehow considered to be the wholesome all-around good girl. Yet she's the one known for going from guy to guy to guy. Meanwhile, Miley Cyrus is seen as some Harlot or Jezebel, despite being with really one person for most of her time. That guy? Liam Hemsworth. They would meet on the set of Miley's movie The Last Song, and two would become good friends and eventually become a couple soon after. This movie took place in 2010. The two have been together pretty much the entire time since. It's now 2018, with Miley and Liam just earlier this month making press for a date night at the Oscars Parties.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two had to even shoot down marriage rumors. When you think about it, is Miley as bad as people assume she is? Seemingly not. Hollywood clearly realizes that, and they see how Miley can turn on the overly&nbsp;provocative side for the cameras. Off the set or off the stage, she's a simple person who has dated one guy for near a decade.</p><h2 id=she-s-not-really-the-miley-of-old-anymore><strong>She's Not Really The Miley Of Old Anymore</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When Miley Cyrus came out with her new album, it was a massive difference from her previous work. She spoke of her love of Malibu and most of her songs changed from being overly wild and party oriented to things that meant something to her. She spoke out on even stopping her use of substances, telling Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show about it.</p><p>She said she wanted to evolve, with her career being a prime focus. She told Billboard regarding the decision: “I like to surround myself with people that make me want to get better, more evolved, open. I&nbsp;want to be super clear and sharp&nbsp;because I know exactly where I want to be.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Miley has not spoken out about the&nbsp;usage&nbsp;beyond this. Though her decision to quit has helped her immensely. In the eyes of the public, her reputation has changed quite a lot. The last album ultimately helped this in 2017. Now in 2018, she is still keeping the fans she had during her wild run. Meanwhile, she's also evolving as an artist without going too far with anything. She has also not taken part in anything overly wild since last year. With Hollywood seeing Miley in a new light, but knowing she could still be flexible when called upon for roles...that is pretty significant.
