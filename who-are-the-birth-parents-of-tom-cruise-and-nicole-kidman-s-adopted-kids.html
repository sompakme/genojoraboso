For years, the couple tried to get pregnant and Nicole even suffered multiple pregnancy losses. The first was when she was only 23-years-old and a newlywed. She suffered an ectopic pregnancy. Nicole has admitted to also trying IVF, with no success.</p><p>Nicole later suffered another loss nearly a decade later, shortly before divorcing Tom. The pair had already adopted their son and daughter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I had a miscarriage at the end of my marriage, but I had an ectopic pregnancy at the beginning of my marriage. It was incredibly traumatic for me. Sometimes you share your grief,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole said to Marie Claire in 2007</a>.</p><p>At the time, the actress said she was still hopeful about having a successful pregnancy. “What will be will be. It’s in God’s hands,” she added. Only a year later, the actress gave birth to a daughter, Sunday, in 2008. This was her first child with her husband, country singer Keith Urban, whom she married in 2006.</p><p>The couple later welcomed a second daughter, Faith, via gestational surrogate in 2010. The baby is biologically Nicole and Keith’s.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Is Tom Cruise And Nicole Kidman's Daughter Isabella Jane Doing Now?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite now being a mother-of-four, Nicole hasn’t been afraid to lament on her difficult journey to motherhood. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">More recently, the actress shared</a>, “I know the yearning. That yearning. It’s a huge, aching yearning. And the loss! The loss of a miscarriage is not talked about enough. That’s massive grief to certain women.”</p><p>“There’s an enormous amount of pain and an enormous amount of joy on the other side of it,” Nicole said of finally becoming a mother. “The flip side of going through so much yearning and pain to get there is the feeling of ‘Ahhhh!’ when you have the child.”</p><p>For his part, Tom also went on to have a biological child following his divorce from Nicole. He welcomed a daughter, Suri, with actress Katie Holmes in 2006. The pair were married from 2006 to 2012, only to divorce in a matter of weeks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Various reports claim that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom hasn’t seen his youngest daughter in years</a>. Katie allegedly wanted out of the marriage <a href=#>due to Tom’s involvement in Scientology</a>.

Connor briefly dabbled in acting, with appearances in films like Seven Pounds and Red Dawn, and he’s now a DJ. Isabella is even more out of the public eye. She’s an artist as well as an auditor for the Church of Scientology.</p><p>Due to their private nature, there’s not a lot known about Isabella and Connor’s personal lives. They’re not biological siblings, as they have different birth parents. But the identities of their biological families remain a mystery.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For all the public knows, Isabella and Connor may not know their biological families.

However, the same can’t be said for their relationship with Nicole. The actress is <a href=#>reportedly distant from her oldest kids</a>, largely because they spent most of their time with Tom after the divorce.</p><p>One report says the kids <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">chose to live with Tom after the divorce</a>. They’re now also active members of the Church of Scientology, just like their famous father.</p><p>There’s speculation that Tom’s scientology beliefs fuelled his divorce from Nicole, just like it seemingly played a part in his split from Katie. Given that both their kids are active church members, it’s likely this has <a href=#>further strained Isabella and Connor’s relationship with Nicole</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, since Tom, Nicole, and their offspring are notorious for being private, fans shouldn’t expect any further details on their personal lives, including Isabella and Connor’s biological families.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddlr%2BmedOhnGaamafBqXnPmqmepqSoerCyjK2mpmWTp8Kqv8RmmKecXaO2pLvLnmSkoZSirq%2B%2FjJqbqKikmrFut8idqmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
