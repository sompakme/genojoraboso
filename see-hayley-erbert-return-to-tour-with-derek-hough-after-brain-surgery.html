Her comeback came four months after she underwent <a href=#>emergency brain surgery</a>.</p><p>The So You Think You Can Dance alum told Good Morning America on April 5 that she had been “cleared to rejoin” the tour. Hough added that the couple, who<a href=#> tied the knot</a> in August 2023, could not “wait to dance together again on stage and be back with all of our fans.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Derek-Hough-and-Wife-Hayley-Erbert-Perform-During-Symphony-of-Dance-Tour-2.jpg><p>Erbert, who’s been rocking a buzz cut since her surgery, has been feeling the love from fans during the performances. After her first show back, <a href=#>Erbert teared up</a> as the crowd cheered for her in a video shared via TikTok.</p><p>Hough revealed in December 2023 that Erbert had been taken to the hospital after becoming “disoriented” following a Symphony of Dance Tour stop in Washington D.C.</p><p>“She was diagnosed with a <a href=#>cranial hematoma</a> from a burst blood vessel and required an emergency craniotomy,” Hough continued in an Instagram statement at the time.</p><p>Erbert later underwent a second surgery, a cranioplasty, which Hough shared was “successfully completed as planned” during a December 21 Instagram update.</p><p>Hough praised his wife’s resilience during a February appearance on Good Morning America.</p><p>“During that time, [I] was realizing how important she is — not just as the love of my life — just everyday things,” he said of Erbert’s health scare. “It was a moment [for me] to step up. I thought she was strong, and I had no idea how strong she was.”</p><p>That same month, Erbert talked about experiencing “lots of emotions” throughout her healing journey during an <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram video</a> update.</p><p>“To this day, I still have really good days and I have really bad days, emotionally and physically,” she said. “But I’m healing so much better every single day.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Erbert met Derek in 2014 when she was cast as a dancer in his and sister <strong>Julianne Hough</strong>’s Move Live Tour. The pair began dating the following year and got engaged in June 2022.</p><p>Erbert took a moment to gush about her husband’s talent one month after her brain surgery when he won his 4th Emmy for Dancing With the Stars choreography.</p><p>“What a way to be welcomed home after such an unfathomable month. @derekhough, you continue to amaze me with your drive, brilliance, and commitment to excellence,” she wrote via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> in January. “I have loved being able to witness and be a part of your journey this far and cannot wait to see what else the future holds. I love you more than anything and am so unbelievably proud of you, today and always.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasnZVitaLFy56wZp2il7KzwIyrnK2toqN6tbuMraauql2strW0jJ2cq52bYrWwwcahZJqepJq%2Fbq7RmqCnZaOqv6ix0bJm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
