&#34;It was a fun, challenging experience for me,&#34; de Lesseps, 45, tells UsMagazine.com of her stint on the series. Taking on the role of an art patron who poses semi-nude for a painter, the Bravo reality star says she had no qualms about doffing her duds in front of the camera."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Taking on the role of an art patron who poses semi-nude for a painter, the Bravo reality star says she had no qualms about doffing her duds in front of the camera.</p><p>"[I appear] semi-nude, so I felt comfortable because I was covered and it was tasteful. I didn't have a problem with that," she tells <strong>Us</strong>. "The problem is, you know, saying the lines and keeping yourself covered and being in the right place at the right time."</p><p>To prepare for her scenes — which were shot in January at New York City's Chelsea Piers — de Lesseps enlisted the help of her new boyfriend, Jacques Azoulay.</p><p>"My boyfriend helped me prepare for the role. He read lines with me," de Lesseps says of Azoulay, a French wine distributor. "[The cast and crew] were a great group of people and very supportive of me being there. The director is the one who said, you know, 'We think the Countess is perfect for this role' and I think that they really saw me in that role, embodying that role. It happened very fast. I basically got my lines two days before I shot."</p><p>And now that her first scripted primetime appearance is in the can, de Lesseps says she's ready for more.</p><p>"I've already been called to do another appearance on another pilot on I think USA Network," she says. "I would love to go on 30 Rock for example. <strong>Tina Fey</strong>, call me!"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Law and Order: Special Victims Unit airs Wednesday at 10 p.m. (EST) on NBC.</p><p>By <strong>Allison Corneau</strong> for <a href=#><strong>UsMagazine.com</strong></a>.
