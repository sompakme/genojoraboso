Either way, we’re diving into some of the most memorable costar feuds.</p><p>Some of the <a href=#>toughest to swallow</a> are longtime costars or stars who appear close on screen. <a href=#>Sex and the City</a>, for example, is a show completely about the power of female friendship. However, two of the main stars — <a href=#><strong>Sarah Jessica Parker</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Kim Cattrall</strong></a> — have been at the<a href=#> center of drama for years</a>. The actresses portrayed best friends Carrie and Samantha on the HBO series for six seasons from 1998 to 2004, then in two movies in 2008 and 2010.</p><p>However, when the reports of a third movie was brought up, the drama began to bubble to the surface. In 2017, Cattrall shot down rumors that she wasn’t doing a third movie due to money and in turn, told <strong>Piers Morgan</strong> of Parker, “I really think<a href=#> she could have been nicer</a>. I don’t know what her issue is, I never have.” Parker later stated that <a href=#>she was “just heartbroken”</a> over the comments.</p><p>Ten days later, after <a href=#>Parker sent “condolences”</a> on Cattrall’s <a href=#>Instagram post revealing</a> her brother’s death, the Tell Me a Story star slammed the New Year’s Eve actress.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Your continuous reaching out is a painful reminder of how cruel you really were then and now. Let me make this VERY clear. (If I haven’t already) You are not my family. You are not my friend,” Cattrall wrote via Instagram. “So I’m writing to tell you <a href=#>one last time to stop exploiting our tragedy in order to restore your ‘nice girl’ persona</a>.” She also linked to a story about the “mean-girls culture” on the show that “destroyed” it.</p><p>The Sex and the City feud is one of many from popular TV and films.
