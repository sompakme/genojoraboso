With that being said, it is not surprising for children to look like a combination of both their parents. In some cases, however, one of the parent's traits are more dominant than the other and their offspring take on those traits. Now, if you are lucky enough to have a beautiful and famous mom or dad and you happen to take on a striking resemblance to them, the world is your oyster.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s all in the genes and we know it. Even though the simplest features, like your eye or hair color, have a complex beginning, it's still pretty normal for a child to exhibit several features from a parent that are extremely similar. How many times have you been to a family get together where you hear, “Wow you look just like (insert the name of a member of your family here)?" Some of the famous and beautiful celebrity parents and their mini-me lookalikes that we are about to look at really require a double take. The resemblance is simply uncanny. How lucky are these kids to have gotten the best of the best DNA from mom or dad to become little clones of them?</p><h2 id=madonna-and-lourdes>Madonna And Lourdes</h2><p>Madonna learned that she was pregnant with her first child, Lourdes, while she was filming Evita in Argentina. Lourdes has been making headlines ever since the moment she was born, I mean, come on, she is Madonna’s first kid! Madonna has every reason to be proud of Lourdes because she is not only beautiful but is known to be incredibly smart and talented.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 21-year-old’s list of achievements in her young life is something that most of us will never accomplish in our entire lifetime. She is an aspiring model, she has helped Madonna publish books, she can speak several languages, and she has a fashion and beauty line as well. As if all that is not enough, she was blessed with beauty and her looks are amazingly&nbsp;similar to her mom's. Talk about having your cake and eating it too.</p><h2 id=reese-witherspoon-and-ava-phillippe>Reese Witherspoon And Ava Phillippe</h2><p>How lucky for 18-year-old Ava Phillippe that she is the spitting image of her gorgeous 42-year-old mom, Reese Witherspoon. She just recently had her very first and second modeling debut in a matter of days from each other and they were with two separate companies. The first was for Rodarte, which is a Los Angeles-based clothing and accessory company for their Fall/Winter 2018 Portrait Series. She is also the face of another company, Draper James, Reese’s very own line of clothes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just days after her modeling debut with Rodarte, she unveiled right alongside her mom, the Draper James Spring 2018 collection. Both of the look-alike blond beauties played off each other, laughing and having a great time. Ava&nbsp;claims to be Reese’s biggest fan and said, “I love being around my mom, and this shoot was an opportunity to have fun and support her work as a female entrepreneur." That's the family spirit!</p><h2 id=cindy-crawford-and-kaia-gerber>Cindy Crawford And Kaia Gerber</h2><p>Wow, how hard must it be for Kaia Gerber to look exactly like her supermodel mom, Cindy Crawford? If you ever had any doubt the supermodel gene was hereditary, this should most certainly put it to rest. The uncanny likeness was recently captured in Kaia’s Versace campaign when she appeared looking a lot like Cindy Crawford did in the '90s era when she modeled in Vogue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kaia shared the image of her retro-twinning on her Instagram. Her voluminous locks, dark eyes, strong bone structure and power brows are the foolproof common denominator for the mother-daughter duo. The only doppelganger giveaway is that Kaia is missing her mom’s very famous mole over her lip.</p><h2 id=goldie-hawn-and-kate-hudson>Goldie Hawn And Kate Hudson</h2><p>Apparently, it is quite the thing for children of celebs, no matter how old they are, to post a retro, or throwback photo trying to recapture an image of their look-alike parent. Goldie Hawn is now 72 years-old, can you believe that? Her almost-39-year-old daughter, Kate Hudson claims that mom gave her the best advice&nbsp;about love that she has ever received. That’s not all that mom gave Kate as we can see how much the two really resemble each other.</p><p>Here is the perfect case where the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree and what a wonderful tree it is! They both share the same beautiful bright eyes, big smiles, and very similar bone structure. The resemblance is simply undeniable, so much so it’s hard to believe they are 15 years apart and not twins.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=demi-moore-and-rumer-willis>Demi Moore And Rumer Willis</h2><p>Looking more like twins than a mother-daughter duo, Demi Moore and Rumer Willis strikingly resemble each other. The 55-year-old mom has the body and face of a woman half her age. Her daughter Rumer is 29 years old and is the spitting image of her stunning mother.</p><p>What is great about this duo is that their bond goes way beyond just the physical similarities. They have a strong and loving mother-daughter relationship and in a birthday post one year, Rumor put up a sentimental message which captioned a photo of her as a baby with mom: "Thank you for showing me what a beautiful, strong, kind, intelligent and magical woman looks like and giving me the best role model a daughter could ask for. I love you with all my heart mama."&nbsp;</p><h2 id=christie-brinkley-and-sailor-brinkley-cook>Christie Brinkley And Sailor Brinkley Cook</h2><p>We all know that 64-year-old Christie Brinkley had an extremely successful career in the modeling and fashion world and was a very well known supermodel. Well, today Sailor Brinkley Cook is following in her mother’s footsteps and at only 19 years old, she is already hitting the modeling industry by storm.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sailor has graced the pages of a Seventeen magazine issue and has even signed a modeling contract with IMG. This is the same agency that has models like Kate Moss, Karlie Kloss, and Joan Smalls on their roster. Having Christie for a mom is very beneficial for Sailor as she gets valuable insight and advice about the industry like to have fun with the job but be professional and show up on time.</p><h2 id=melanie-griffith-and-dakota-johnson>Melanie Griffith And Dakota Johnson</h2><p>Here is quite the little taboo tidbit about 60-year-old actress Melanie Griffith. At the tender age of 14, she started dating Don Johnson, who was 22 years old at the time. He was co-starring with Melanie’s mother in <i>The Harrad Experiment</i>. They were married in 1976 for only six months before they called it quits. After a string of bad relationships and spending some time in rehabilitation, Melanie and Don reconnected and remarried in 1989 and Dakota Johnson was born. Melanie has had some really rough patches in her life but&nbsp;one bright spot in her life is Dakota.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For <i>Fifty Shades</i> star Dakota Johnson, she has not only gotten the glow from her mom’s genes but the Hollywood wisdom from her as well. Melanie has given Dakota great looks and great advice. What more could anyone ask for?</p><h2 id=angelina-jolie-and-shiloh>Angelina Jolie And Shiloh</h2><p>Without a doubt, 42-year old Angelina Jolie is one of the most beautiful women in the world. She has gone through some serious medical hardships like a double mastectomy and an ovariectomy while she was in the prime of her career. She is an advocate for gene testing and has spoken about it publicly to make women aware there are strong options for breast cancer.</p><p>She is a strong woman with strong genes and her 11-year-old daughter Shiloh very much resembles her. Shiloh looks just like dad too, and when your dad is Brad Pitt, I guess that is not a bad thing. In a Vanity Fair interview, when Shiloh was just 4 years old, Jolie said, “She wants to be a boy, so we had to cut her hair. She likes to wear boys’ everything." Even though Shiloh still dresses the boy part, she is a technically&nbsp;a female, and I’m sure Angelina is keeping a close eye out for the defective BRCA1 gene that runs in her family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=heidi-klum-and-leni-samuel>Heidi Klum and Leni Samuel</h2><p>The 44-year-old <i>America’s Next Top Model </i>host and ex-Victoria’s Secret model Heidi Klum, is sporting more these days than just her own good looks. With her soon-to-be 14-year-old daughter Leni Samuel by her side, they have been delivering the next level of twinning moments for some time now.</p><p>From coast to coast, New York to Los Angeles, they have been spotted with matching hairdos and clothing. It’s funny because most teenage girls reject their mom’s beauty aesthetics, but what teen in their right mind would reject supermodel Heidi Klum’s? "She gets that from me" is a phrase that Heidi can really say without any hesitation. This new generation A-list beauty is proof positive that the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree. Time will tell if Leni will follow in her mom’s entrepreneurial footsteps but in the looks department, she already has.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=heather-locklear-and-ava-sambora>Heather Locklear And Ava Sambora</h2><p>20-year-old Ava Sambora is the daughter of the&nbsp;56-year-old actress, Heather Locklear, and the 58-year-old, Richie Sambora, the lead guitarist for the rock band Bon Jovi. Talk about getting some great genetic hand-me-downs. How could Ava be anything but beautiful and successful? Well, she is making a name for herself as a model and after doing some bikini photo shoots it is easy to see why she has already had a lot of success in her modeling career. Ava told ET in an interview regarding her bikini shots that she wanted everything to be very tasteful and it was.</p><p>The only negative thing I can say here is that it is a shame Heather did not have any more offspring with any of her other ex’s. At one point, she was married to Tommy Lee, Mötley Crüe’s drummer, and had a four-year relationship with the actor, Jack Wagner, a fellow <i>Melrose Place</i> alum.&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=uma-thurman-and-maya-thurman-hawke>Uma Thurman And Maya Thurman-Hawke</h2><p>Being one of Hollywood’s most captivating stars on the big screen, 47-year-old Uma Thurman’s timeless beauty has clearly been passed down to her 19-year-old daughter, Maya. <i>Kill Bill</i> star, Uma, got married to the actor, director, writer Ethan Hawke, when she was seven months pregnant with Maya, so it is only genetically natural that Maya inherited the acting gene as well.</p><p>Maya is an actress and made her screen debut in 2017 in the BBC’s adaptation of <i>Little Women</i>, where she played Jo March. It is also confirmed that Maya is set to star in the upcoming third season of <i>Stranger Things. </i>She will play one of the main characters whose name is Robin and she is bored with her day job and finds a dark secret in Hawkins. Her character is described as an "alternative girl" and with her mother’s ethereal looks, she should be eye-catching.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-garner-and-violet-affleck>Jennifer Garner and Violet Affleck</h2><p>Jennifer Garner started dating Ben Affleck in 2004 after meeting and becoming friends with him on the sets of <i>Pearl Harbor</i> in 2001 and <i>Daredevil</i> in 2003. They got married in 2005 and during their 10-year marriage, had three kids. Now at age 12, Jennifer and Ben’s oldest daughter, Violet, is the spitting image of her mom. When we say that this little girl hit the genetic jackpot with her mom’s exact same lips, big smile, bone structure, and dimples, we are not lying.</p><p>Sadly, with the fame and good fortune of being born to beautiful celebrity parents, there is a darker side. Violet, along with her mom and dad had to obtain a restraining order against a stalker, Steven Burky. In 2010, he was arrested outside of Violet’s preschool. He pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity (that’s comforting) and was ruled insane and sentenced to a mental institution in California.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gwyneth-paltrow-and-apple-martin>Gwyneth Paltrow and Apple Martin</h2><p>Sorry, I just can’t help myself and I have to say it. In this case, the “Apple” really doesn’t fall too far from the tree. I know, bad, right? Well for 13-year-old Apple Martin, it is clear she is the mirror image of her mother, 45-year-old Gwyneth Paltrow. The British rock band, Coldplay’s, lead singer, Chris Martin, is her dad and the couple had one other child together before splitting up in 2016. Apple is their oldest and with her pale blue eyes, blond hair, and shape of her nose, there is no doubt that she is her mother’s mini-me look alike. Gwyneth told Oprah how she came to name her daughter and explained, "It sounded so sweet and it conjured such a lovely picture for me – you know, apples are so sweet and they're wholesome and it's biblical – and I just thought it sounded so lovely and ... clean! And I just thought, 'Perfect!'"</p><h2 id=tina-fey-and-alice-zenobia-richmond>Tina Fey And Alice Zenobia Richmond</h2><p>How amazingly alike in the looks department are Tina Fey and her 12-year-old daughter Alice Zenobia Richmond? Jeff Richmond is Alice’s dad and he and Elizabeth Stamatina, aka Tina Fey, got married in 2001 and have been going strong ever since. Jeff is a pianist, and later became the composer on <i>30 Rock.</i></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alice has received mom’s great beauty and at the 2018 SAG Awards, Alice accompanied mom as her plus one. During the ceremony, Fey’s big moment when her name was announced for female actor in a comedy series, Alice, peaked out from behind mom and gave fans a wave. Alice looks so much like her mom, she was cast as a younger version of her character in a flashback scene for <i>30 Rock. </i>In her appearance, she even looked more like her mom by showing off her major attitude, eye-roll and all.</p><h2 id=kate-beckinsale-and-lily-sheen>Kate Beckinsale And Lily Sheen</h2><p>44-year-old Kate Beckinsale is a stunning beauty and with 1.6 million Instagram followers, it appears that people like to see what she posts. One time on Instagram, she posted a selfie of her and her ex, Michael Sheen with their daughter, Lily. Lily appeared to be very embarrassed in the photo, but that’s what parents do to their kids on social media, right?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kate wrote a gushing post in response to her daughter's prom picture post where she looks like a mirror image of her mother. Kate wrote,"You take my breath away @lily_beckinsale #prom you're funny and clever and gorgeous and just enough crazy to be my favourite person in the world..." That too perfect caption really sums it up, 19-year-old Lily is clearly following in her mother’s genetic footsteps with great looks and a sassy personality to boot.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhpZWLCr6%2FAp6WyZZmirqix0mamn2WTmrmmroydmK6fmKmys7%2BMsJ%2BoZZykvKx5xLGYnKycrnqttcqeZK2glZ6%2FbrzAq5ynrKNk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
