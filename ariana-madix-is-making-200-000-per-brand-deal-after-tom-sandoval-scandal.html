Her ex’s affair has catapulted both of their names in the spotlight. And as the victim of Tom’s cheating, it’s made many viewers #TeamAriana, whether they’re hardcore fans of the show or not.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Bre Tiesi Claims Nick Cannon Has Too Many Kids To Pay Child Support</a></span></p><p>If TMZ’s estimate is true, Ariana is likely making more than six times what she was per brand deal than before the scandal.</p><p>Branding expert Bernt Ullman estimates to the publication she was charging between $15,000 to $30,000 per collaboration, which can include social media posts, among other targets.</p><p>After the affair was exposed earlier this year, Tom moved out of the home he shared with Ariana. It was also reported that Raquel checked into a mental health facility. The reality star as well as her family have allegedly been receiving death threats in the wake of the scandal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the Vanderpump Rules season 10 finale, Ariana reveals that Raquel was trying to send a letter to Tom by delivering it to their formerly shared house. Ariana added that she doesn’t believe Raquel and Tom have quit seeing each other, despite their insistence.</p><p>"I didn't open it. It was addressed to him and it was her handwriting," <a href=#>Ariana explained</a> . "I just brought in the mail, saw it, put it on the table and walked away."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though Ariana’s finances may be booming since her ex’s infidelity, the same can’t be said for Tom, who alleges that his business has suffered in the wake of the scandal. Not only have fans been encouraging the public to boycott Tom’s two bars, TomTom and Schwartz & Sandy’s, but the establishments have also faced vandalism.</p><p><a href=#>Tom’s initial statement</a> about the affair in March directly asked fans to leave his businesses out of it, especially because their performance also affects his business partner, Tom Schwartz.</p><p>"Schwartz & Sandy's might have my name on it, but also there are 3 other partners and 20 employees, who especially rely on the restaurant for income for them and their families," Tom said. "Just like TomTom, I'm a small part of a much bigger thing. Please direct ur anger towards me and not them. They did nothing wrong."</p><p>In a more recent update, Schwartz said their business was doing better than before, since the scandal has brought renewed interest. But it’s still unclear how Tom infidelity is affecting their friendship as a whole.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kroy Biermann Claims Kim Zolciak’s Gambling Caused Financial Troubles</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>E!
