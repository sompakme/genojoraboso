I gave you a global platform. Use it for your good or it will destroy you.”</p><p>A follow-up video was then posted with a lengthy caption, detailing where fans could find Odom until he had things sorted out with his Instagram and Twitter accounts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Unfortunately my social media platforms are being held hostage by my ex and we are working hard to recover my passwords for IG and Twitter~ if any of y’all know someone who can get it reset for me hit my brand managers DM ASAP,” he wrote.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">An Inside Look ‘Teen Mom 2’ Cast Members Jade And Sean’s Relationship</a></span></p><p>“In the meantime come holla at me I need y’all to SUBSCRIBE to my youtube, my twitch and follow me on snapchat Lucky7lefty - If you got an iphone im on club house so drop in, Im starting a room about Mental Health, Toxic and Abusive Relationships and Self Love.”</p><p>The father of two had strongly implied he had been a victim of domestic abuse in his relationship with Parr, who he had called it quits with on multiple occasions, though he had never complained of such issues in the past.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This time, however, it seemed as if their split was final — especially since Odom had to address the situation with fans on social media, which subsequently allowed people to target him with jokes over the fact that he not only took Parr back on multiple occasions but she also held his social media accounts hostage.</p><p>While Khloe Kardashian’s ex-husband was still able to post on the platform, he supposedly couldn’t change his password, which allowed Parr to continue logging herself into the account — <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">at least that’s what Odom insinuated in his lengthy caption</a> as he pled for fans to help him gain full control over his page.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In response to the accusations made by her former partner, Parr took to her Instagram Story to deny any wrongdoing, insisting that her ex was being brainwashed to portray her in a negative light.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Will Khloé Kardashian And Tristan Thompson Get Married In 2021?</a></span></p><p>“I find these accusations from Lamar & whoever he’s working with extremely disappointing,” she said in a since-deleted post, according to Radar Online. “We are no longer together and haven’t been for a while. We both know the truth and I assure you no truth is being told on their end.”</p><p>Odom offered Parr a response, asserting that she had allegedly been hacking his social media accounts every few months during the time that they were together. He added: “Your receipts are no good that’s from a year ago.</p><p>“I’ve recently begged you to release my password. I can only post using the phone you set up — you don’t want me to expose you. So stop. Give me my password and my passport.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Khloé Kardashian Fans Say She ‘Looks Miserable’ After Tristan Is Seen With Blonde</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdoa6urdFmpp2nnah6psSMn6CappOasm6%2BxJ%2BsrJ2UYrWquYyampydo6h6tbuMoaCsZaOksKqty2aknpyZlnqir8KorKeso2Kup8DEq2StoJWev26%2Fz6WgrWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
