It houses an enormous kitchen and distinct dining area for entertaining guests and arranging parties. The palatial house is a four-story mansion with six luxurious bedrooms, an impressive washroom, and a 200 feet posh green garden that accommodates a delightful summer house. Additionally, there are four reception quarters for casual companies.</p><p>The property's prior masters are believed to be financier Ben Goldsmith and Burberry chief designer Christopher Bailey according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>. Samuel Johns was the leading architect of the house in 1860. This sprawling mansion is estimated to be worth $25 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-glamorous-geneva-apartment>The Glamorous Geneva Apartment</h2><p><a href=#>Lewis Hamilton is also the proud owner</a> of a beguiling Geneva apartment situated above a six-story structure in Luins village, Nyon.

The home is placed in a plush locality in Geneva and has a glorious ambiance. As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Essentially Sports</a> reports, the F1 sports champion, Hamilton, is often spotted hanging around this home spending quality time, which is not surprising as it is an absolute joy of a home.</p><h2 id=the-princely-monaco-condo>The Princely Monaco Condo</h2><p>Being home to one of the most illustrious and <a href=#>esteemed Formula One racing</a> stages, almost all racers have a luxurious residence in Monaco to unwind from the tracks. Numerous former and current F1 drivers reside in Monaco, and therefore it's clear Hamilton wouldn't miss out on owning a house based in the principality.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is believed that the British sports star spends his time at the gym and the sauna when he resides in one of the world’s smallest countries in the world. His exceptional apartment is in the elite Fontvieille district, with a minor population of only a little above 3000 people. Hamilton’s <a href=#>exclusive Monaco home</a> houses a 300 square feet sun terrace, a steam room, and four bathrooms.</p><p>According to Reports, the F1 champ splurged an estimate of $15 million to get his hands on this fantastic property. It has been reported that Hamilton chose a more modest home compared to the other properties in the area as they were on the market for double the price. Hamilton made an intelligent decision to go with the wonderful deal he got on his current residence.</p><h2 id=the-expensive-big-apple-penthouse>The Expensive Big Apple Penthouse</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hamilton's New York penthouse was listed for $57 million in 2019, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>. This 8,900 square foot property at 443 Greenwich in Tribeca is housed in the exact building as other celebrity residents such as Jake Gyllenhaal, Meg Ryan, Bella Hadid, The Weeknd, Jessica Biel, and Justin Timberlake. Tribeca has been ranked as the most costly neighborhood in Manhattan consecutively for the past few years, largely due to the rush of super-prime condos that are on the market for tens of millions of dollars.</p><p>Hamilton has a kinship to America, particularly the east coast, where he has held two residences in New York. In 2019, he splurged $43.4 million on a Manhattan penthouse partially owned by NFL legend Tom Brady and his wife supermodel Gisele Bundchen, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a>&nbsp;reports. The sprawling home of 6,547 square feet comprised a spacious outdoor arena, overlooked the Hudson River, and housed a fitness center, squash court, swimming pool, wine cellar, fitness center, and library. The Brit champion’s neighbors included Austin Powers star Mike Myers and <a href=#>Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Being one of Britain's wealthiest sports persons ever, Lewis Hamilton has more than enough money to splurge on expensive and stunning properties spread around the globe.
