Many attribute his huge boost of income to his stake in Microsoft. While the savvy businessman parted ways with the company back in 2014, he still holds 4% stack in the Windows manufactures in which he oversaw for 14 years. The stack acclimates to 333 million shares, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a> reports. As Microsoft now stands as the second American company to reach $2 trillion in valuation, Ballmer certainly sees a pretty penny from his stake.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ballmer was said to be one of Microsoft's very first employees, even being classmates with tech legend Bill Gates during his days at Harvard.&nbsp; After being an integral figure of the company since the 80's, Ballmer became its CEO back in 2004.</p><p>Though this surely amounts to a great deal of Ballmer's fortune, it'd be a mistake to overlook his ties with the Clippers. Ballmer purchased the team for $2 billion the same year he stepped down from his position at Microsoft. Ballmer had previous experience in the field of managing athletes while he was at Harvard.</p><p>"I learned the most important thing I've ever learned," the billionaire recounts to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Mag</a>, "The most important business learning exercise was as manager of the Harvard football team. I had to come in, memorize the names of 100 people basically in a day, and I had to get up in front of 100 football players—which is not exactly—they're a kind of rowdy lot</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Buying the team, which is now valued at $2.6 billion, helped Ballmer to lower his tax rate. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ProPublica</a>, his tax rate stands at 12 percent, with him reporting up to $700 million in losses throughout the years. The publication shows that, while the Clippers owner made&nbsp;$656 million in 2017, he only paid $78 million in taxes.</p><p>Ballmer isn't the only one who'll be joining the $100 billion club. Closing in on becoming the 10th member is&nbsp;Larry Ellison. The founder of Oracle almost made it with the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg Billionaires Index</a> listing his net worth at $98 million.</p><p><span class=next-single>Read Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Bill Gates Teams With Warren Buffett To Build Next Generation Nuclear Reactor</a></span></p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Mag</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ProPublica</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSwrbXPqZyrq12kxK%2Bx0WaqrZ2mmnqjrculpJ6qXWZ9cXnBoqOloZ%2BjfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
