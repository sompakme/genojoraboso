&#34;I was in Austin, Texas, doing a radio promo tour and we had somebody showing us the best barbecue joint in Austin, so we had gotten piles of food and we were sitting outside on these picnic tables, eating barbecue, and I got the call and I literally had to answer with my elbow because I had so much barbecue on my fingers,” the 21-year-old tells Us Weekly."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Sick! I’m playing Coachella! Yeah!’ It was a really good moment — barbecue and tears.”</p><p>Not only will this be the “Hypnotic” singer’s first time performing at the music festival, but it will also be the first time she attends the full event.</p><p>“I’ve been to Coachella for like, three hours, literally,” the singer-songwriter says. “I went two years ago when Outkast was playing and I had a friend who had a last-minute ticket that they weren’t using, so I just went to watch Outkast, but I left right after cause I had nowhere to stay.”</p><p>While Zella is a Coachella rookie, she has experience with the festival circuit, having performed at BottleRock, AxS and Hangout Music Festival in 2015.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"They’re exhausting and you really need to pace yourself, especially if you’re going to be staying and enjoying the festival outside of your own performance,” she advises. “It’s really taxing and there’s a lot of people to talk to and the element at Coachella is very intense. I’m making sure that I’m drinking more water than I am wine, and getting more sleep than I am pulling all-nighters so that I can really sustain myself.”</p><p>As far as her festival style goes, she says, "I want it to be a surprise, but it’s one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen in my life. It’s vintage, it’s all silk, it has three pieces and it’s all the same fabric. It looks kind of…I can’t, I can’t, I can’t give it away! I’m sorry! I’m so excited!”</p><p>The singer-songwriter will be performing on both April 16 and April 23, where she will perform songs from her 2015 album, <i>Kicker</i>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaznZyhrm6wwLJkqJ6Wmr%2B0eceeqWaZlKu2pLGMraZmm5%2BWsKmxy6WYZpmkqbKvsMSeqmavYmV%2FcYOVaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
