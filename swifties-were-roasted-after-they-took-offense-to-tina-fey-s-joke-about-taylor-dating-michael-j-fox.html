The two are still considered among the best hosts ever at the Golden Globes. However, not every person enjoyed their jokes, and that held true for <strong><a href=#>Taylor Swift</a></strong> and her fans.</p><p>In the following, we're going to take a look back at the joke Fey and Poehler made about the potential of Swift dating Michael J. Fox's son. The two were referencing comments made by Michael J. Fox, though some fans did not find it amusing.

Fox's Son</h2><p>Looking back at the history of hosts at the Golden Globes, few did it better than Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. However, it seemed like someone did take exception to their jokes, and that included none other than Taylor Swift. It was reported that Swift wasn't happy at the dig the two took at her love life. In truth, the joke was very tame, and referenced a past statement made by Michael J. Fox.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“You know what Taylor Swift? You stay away from Michael J Fox’s son,” said Fey. “Or go for it,” Poehler replied. “No, she needs some me-time to learn about herself."</p><p>So where did this all stem from? It was all started by Michael J. Fox, who said he didn't want his son dating the artist.</p><p>“No. No …. Just back off, he said. “I don’t keep up with it all,” he said. “But Taylor Swift writes songs about everybody she goes out with, right? What a way to build a career.”</p><p>Taylor Swift's fans immediately went into defense mode.</p><p>One fan wrote, "Everyone acts like Taylor is the only one writing about her relationship experiences… when almost every single artists does the exact same thing. It is so WEIRD to me that it’s only ever a problem for Taylor. I think it’s out of pure envy that she is as insanely successful as she is. It’s always been a trend to hate on Taylor. Nearly EVERY artist writes about love & heartbreak, hardly any of them are able to add the storytelling element to it the way Taylor does."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/all-of-taylor-swift-s-famous-exes-ranked-by-how-much-fans-loved-them-together-3.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>All Of Taylor Swift's Famous Exes, Ranked By How Much Fans Loved Them Together</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift has dated celebrities like Harry Styles, John Mayer and Calvin Harris, and her fans have plenty of thoughts about each relationship.</span><p>Other fans clapped back, stating that the joke wasn't meant with any harm.</p><p>"The real joke here: Taylor Swift fans getting offended." another fan wrote, "The funniest part is that people on here are offended by this."</p><p>Not only were a portion of fans upset, but the same held true for Swift herself.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-was-apparently-upset-by-the-tina-fey-joke-at-the-golden-globes>Taylor Swift Was Apparently Upset By The Tina Fey Joke At The Golden Globes</h2><p>Both Tina Fey and Amy Poehler were surprised by the way fans and Taylor Swift reacted to the joke years ago. Discussing what had gone down, both Fey and Poehler did respond with some sarcasm to the situation.</p><p>"If anyone was going to get mad at us, I thought it would be James Cameron," Fey revealed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I did not see that one coming. It was a joke. It was a lighthearted joke." Poehler added, "Aw, I feel bad if she was upset. I am a feminist, and she is a young and talented girl. That being said, I do agree I am going to hell. But for other reasons. Mostly boring tax stuff."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar44330383-1.jpg> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/kim-kardashian-and-taylor-swift.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>North West Disses Taylor Swift Like Her Dad Kanye As Kim Kardashian Rushes To Delete TikTok</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The 10-year-old seemingly dissed Taylor Swift in the video after her dad's years-long feud with her.</span><p>Ultimately, it seems like things weren't as bad as they were made out to be as a couple of years later, <a href=#>Swift and Poehler presented together at the same award show</a>.</p><h2 id=the-view-hosts-took-exception-to-taylor-swift-39-s-reaction-to-jokes-made-by-jo-koy-at-the-golden-globes>The View Hosts Took Exception To Taylor Swift's Reaction To Jokes Made By Jo Koy At The Golden Globes</h2><p>We all know by now, Jo Koy completely bombed at the Golden Globes. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The View panel discussed his monologue</a> and, according to Whoopi Goldberg, the comic had trouble reading the room.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ttweb_taylor-swift-s-fans-absolutely-hate-these-midnights-lyrics-despite-the-massive-success-of-the-album_bk_a1.jpg><p>"These gigs, these hosting gigs are brutal.

It's not an easy gig. If you read any of the reviews of some of the gigs that I've had, where they just wished me into the cornfields, die on the vine, it's not an easy gig."</p><p>Sara Haines in particular took exception to Swift's reaction. "What bothers me more in watching this is, get a sense of humor, because we need to protect these national treasures called our comedians, because life needs them."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We need to stop binding them in, fencing them in.
