"We were sitting in Memphis in the suit, she said I don't know if I want to be here,” Priscilla explained. “She would go on about Ben and how she was still grieving, this was a couple of months [before Lisa Marie's death]."</p><p>Lisa Marie passed away unexpectedly in January 2021, while she was in the hospital following a cardiac arrest at her residence. She is survived by her three daughters, with two of them being minors.</p><p>Last May, it was reported that <a href=#>Lisa Marie’s million-dollar estate had finally been settled</a> following a feud between her mother, Priscilla, and eldest daughter, Riley Keough.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2016, Lisa Marie made changes to her will, replacing her mother, Priscilla, and her former business manager, Barry Siegel, as the trustees with her oldest children, Riley and Benjamin Keough. Unfortunately, with Benjamin’s death by suicide in 2020, it left Riley as the sole trustee.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lisa-marie-presley-s-funeral-was-eerily-similar-to-her-dad-elvis-presley-s.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Lisa Marie Presley's Funeral Was Eerily Similar To Her Dad, Elvis Presley's</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Lisa Marie Presley's tragic death was similar to that of her father Elvis Presley, but their funerals were also almost identical.</span><p>This situation prompted Priscilla to contest the will's validity following her daughter’s death. She raised concerns about not receiving notice of the amendment while her daughter was alive, questioned the authenticity of Lisa Marie's signature, and even pointed out a misspelling of her name in the document.</p><p>Upon reaching the age of 25, Lisa Marie inherited a trust fund worth $100 million from her father's estate. She played a significant role within the Elvis Presley Trust and its business entity, Elvis Presley Enterprises Inc., actively contributing to the expansion of the generational wealth established by her father.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lisa-marie-rsquo-s-family-feuded-over-her-million-dollar-estate>Lisa Marie’s Family Feuded Over Her Million-Dollar Estate</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/priscilla-presley-80th-venice-international-film-festival-2.jpg><p>Eventually, Priscilla reached a settlement agreement with her eldest granddaughter over Lisa Marie’s will. “The parties would like to report that they’ve reached a settlement,” <a href=#>Priscilla’s attorney said in a statement</a>.</p><p>Her lawyer also denied any bad blood between Priscilla and her daughters. “The families are happy,” he continued. “Everyone is happy, unified, together and excited for the future.”</p><p>An autopsy was performed on Lisa Marie following her death, which concluded that a bowel obstruction caused the fatality. The obstruction occurred due to adhesions that developed as a consequence of a weight-loss surgery she had undergone several years prior. She’d gone into cardiac arrest at her Calabasas home before paramedics arrived, though Lisa Marie eventually passed away at the hospital, a year after her son’s suicide.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinq6GjmLatuMBmp6udo6GyunnRnq2emZyoeq210ppkppminrK0ecyepa2ZnGK1pq3LrZ9mnJWpsrO1zquYraGenHqjscWoqZ5llJqutbSO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
