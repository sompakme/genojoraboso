I don’t mind making $1 million a month and keeping my soul.”</p><p>In 2016, <a href=# id=auto-tag_kevin-hart data-tag=kevin-hart>Kevin Hart</a> was lauded as the world top paid comedian thanks to his sold-out tours with some becoming a hit at the box office. Jerry Seinfeld&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">returned to the top spot</a> last year due to his Netflix specials and series Comedian In Cars Getting Coffee.&nbsp;</p><p>But Williams believes Hart used his<a href=#> previously squashed</a> quarrel with Tiffany Haddish to bring more attention to&nbsp;his new comedy Night School. The film, developed by Hart, was released Friday and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">is expected</a> to make over $30 million in its debut.</p><p>“You’re gonna see me in real life and I know you’re gonna see this because you got people seeing this that work for you,” he continued.”I was just at the gym and now I’m heading to Mayweather’s.. I’m gonna knock your motherf**king mouth sideways boi. Everyone just saw that you would do anything to sell a movie.”</p><p><a href=# id=auto-tag_leslie-jones data-tag=leslie-jones>Leslie Jones</a> slammed both comedians for using her name as a means of what they’ve done for women in comedy. Rel Howery, who was also named dropped by both comedians, recently shared how he felt bad for Williams in the situation.</p><p>“There’s a reason why most of us haven’t given him jobs,”<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> he said</a>. “He’s so talented, so funny, but I don’t know what he’s really angry about. The crazy thing is, maybe like five years ago he pulled me to the side and was like, ‘you going to be a star one day. Don’t let them burn you out.’”</p><p>See the rest of Williams’ comments up top.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Leslie Jones Slams Kevin Hart And Katt Williams: “None Of Those Ni**as Put Me On”</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6CutcCMsKClpJmWurR5yp6toqZdna6zwIytoJ%2BekaPGbrTAnZuiq5hiu6qzx61krJuYpLytecGenJ9lZmWFdYSRaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
