After all, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he nearly blew his 'Hairspray' audition</a>. But it all ended well, and Zac continued on with plenty of musical work afterward.</p><p>In fact, he's made some good money -- and earned plenty of fans -- throughout 'High School Musical' and tons of other films and TV shows. He's arguably one of the most recognizable actors today, even if he hasn't made a name for himself in an action franchise or as a romantic lead.</p><p>So why are fans so critical of his career trajectory?</p><h2 id=why-do-fans-say-zac-efron-s-career-fell-short>Why Do Fans Say Zac Efron's Career Fell Short?</h2><p>Fans aren't hypercritical of Zac's acting talent -- far from it. Instead, they <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wonder</a> why he didn't catch on as much as other actors. In short, they started speculating why the teen heartthrob didn't go straight from Disney to something "really big."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, definitions vary as to what constitutes "really big" in Hollywood. But one fan suggests that with the right career moves, Zac could have become the next Brad Pitt or Matt Damon. Instead, his work "petered out," say Redditors.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="This Is Why Fans Say Zac Efron Is 'One Of Them'" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is Why Fans Say Zac Efron Is 'One Of Them'</a></span></p><p>It's not for a lack of talent, though. Commenters agreed that Zac could tackle nearly every film or TV role that they could imagine him in. So what's the reason for his failure to launch to a higher star level?</p><h2 id=fans-say-zac-efron-works-for-fun>Fans Say Zac Efron Works For Fun</h2><p>Fans' main assumption about Zac Efron's career is that he chooses what he wants to work on. That, they say, is why he hasn't completely blown up the way that other stars on his same trajectory have.</p><p>Zac even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">turned down millions from a reality star</a>,&nbsp;so he's been purposeful about his career moves. Fans point to his past projects, calling them "bro comedies," as an example of Zac exercising choice over his acting gigs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They even compare him to Adam Sandler, suggesting that since Zac has a comfortable nest egg from his more successful projects, he can pursue fun work now. Besides, fans say, "Plenty of good actors make a career out of never taking themselves too seriously." So, they speculate, Zac may be one of them.</p><p>At the same time, he's done some passion projects, such as a documentary series where he traveled the world, that highlight what Efron really cares about. While being a teen heartthrob is a short-term gig, being someone that fans can continue to fawn over for various reasons throughout the decades is far better for one's mature image.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="The Real Reason Zac Efron Didn’t Leave Acting For Music" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Real Reason Zac Efron Didn’t Leave Acting For Music</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdr66kecSfqaimXZius7HEq2SfmZyherS0zquraA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
