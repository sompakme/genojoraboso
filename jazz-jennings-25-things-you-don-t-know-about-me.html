1. I wear tie-dye almost every day.
2. I’ve always loved mermaids. When I was 8, I got a sewing machine and made my first fabric mermaid tail. When I was 12, I started my own business making silicone mermaid tails.
3. I love watching anime, and have watched more than 30 different anime shows."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I sketch an eye almost every day.</p><p>6. I have four cats, named Nemo, Luna, Leo and Dunkin. 7. I enjoy giving massages to all my friends and family. I’ve been told I have a <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a>.</p><p>8. My favorite food is anything chocolate. I love chocolate milkshakes!</p><p>9. I’m not afraid of bugs at all, and can hold spiders and cockroaches without flinching. At a sleepover party in sixth grade, I chased all the girls around the house with a cockroach.</p><p>10. I love to crack body parts ­— especially other people’s.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jazz-Jennings-25-Things-You-Dont-Know-About-Me-inset.jpg><p>11. I have a phobia of wrist tendons (called carpophobia) related to my less severe venephobia [fear of veins].</p><p>12. I’m afraid of lizards, which sucks because I live in Florida, where they openly roam. I often find my cat Nemo bringing them back as a treat.</p><p>13. I sing constantly, and my song choices often reflect my current mood. When I’m not singing, my family knows something’s up.</p><p>14. I started playing soccer when I was 5 years old. When I was 8, I was banned from playing at the competitive level for two years because I was told I had an “unfair advantage” being transgender.</p><p>15. My first car was passed down from my dad to my siblings and then to me.</p><p>16. I love all Disney movies (who doesn’t?), but my top three are The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast and, of course, The Little Mermaid.</p><p>17. I drink a ton of water — usually two gallons a day.</p><p>18. I played the first animated transgender child, Zadie, in Amazon’s Danger & Eggs [in 2017].</p><p>19. My favorite movie is [2012’s] Cloud Atlas.</p><p>20. I’m very spiritual and love meditating with crystals.</p><p>21. I’m ranked No. 1 in my graduating high school class.</p><p>22. My favorite shoes are Birkenstocks.</p><p>23. I started playing varsity soccer when I was in ninth grade and was awarded rookie of the year.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>24. I love doing beautiful makeup, but hate wearing it.</p><p>25. I just completed filming Denim, a 20-minute movie about a transgender girl who’s bullied in high school.</p><p>I Am Jazz airs on TLC, Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmaqvequxzaegp5%2BjYn92edOhoKefo2LGsMGMnaanrF2gu7DDjJqZqK2kYrqmew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
