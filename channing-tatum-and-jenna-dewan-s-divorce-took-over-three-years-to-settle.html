Here's why Jenna and Channing's divorce proceedings took forever to finally end.</p><h2 id=jenna-dewan-and-channing-tatum-split-up-in-2018>Jenna Dewan And Channing Tatum Split Up In 2018</h2><p>In 2018, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Channing and Jenna announced that they were breaking up</a>. Jenna actually filed for divorce later that year, and part of the divorce was finalized in 2019.</p><p>After eight years of marriage, the exes had a lot of things to figure out, so no one was surprised when the news of the actual divorce took nearly a year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Publicly, the two seemed united in terms of their parenting plan involving their daughter Everly.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="What Happened Between Channing Tatum And Emma Watson?">What Happened Between Channing Tatum And Emma Watson?</a></span></p><p>They even released a statement at the time of the split, saying they would still be a family because of their daughter. In 2020, the former couple apparently settled on a custody agreement for their daughter, sharing joint legal and physical custody.</p><p>However, there were other details that still weren't settled as of April 2021, more than three years after the initial divorce filing.</p><h2 id=did-channing-tatum-and-jenna-dewan-have-a-prenup>Did Channing Tatum And Jenna Dewan Have A Prenup?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar51374595.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In April 2021, E! News reported that Channing and Jenna had not yet finalized the "financial details" of their split. In fact, at that time, Tatum's team requested a trial date to discuss "issues" related to "dissolution, child support, spousal support, attorney fees, division of some property, and reimbursements and credits."</p><p>Though E! News noted that they obtained the request, there weren't details available about the case, and neither Tatum nor Dewan's reps responded to the publication's request for comment.</p><p>Early on, when they first announced the breakup, Channing and Jenna said they wouldn't comment publicly on anything else regarding their relationship. But recently, Jenna shared more details about their breakup and how she took self-care to the next level to move past it.</p><p>Though they stated there was nothing "salacious" behind the split, fans always had their suspicions—but to date, nothing's come of that speculation. The fact that the two broke up so lovingly, as they noted, makes the prolonged divorce proceedings even more confusing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Fans Won't Let Jenna Dewan Walk Back Her Accusations Against Channing Tatum">Fans Won't Let Jenna Dewan Walk Back Her Accusations Against Channing Tatum</a></span></p><p>One factor that does make sense, though, is that the two got married when they were both in the early stages of their fame. Before Jenna Dewan became known as Channing's wife, she was arguably the more famous of the two.</p><p>But Channing's star caught up to his wife's, and not long after, they split up. The circumstances of their relationship and marriage might hint that an important piece was missing from their marriage: a prenup.</p><p>It's unclear whether the former couple had a prenup, and their extended divorce case, including Channing's "issues" with finances and property, suggests that there probably wasn't an agreement on how to split their wealth in the event of a breakup.</p><p>When they got married, there probably wasn't much net worth to worry about, but now, <a href=#>Jenna is worth about $30 million</a>; <a href=#>Channing is worth at least double that</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-jenna-and-channing-39-s-divorce-finally-end>How Did Jenna And Channing's Divorce Finally End?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/jenna-dewan-interview.jpg><p>As of early 2022, Jenna and Channing still hadn't worked out their divorce details. At that time, OK Magazine reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the pair was headed back to court again</a>—but this time, there were more details.</p><p>Apparently, the final financial piece came down to earnings from the Magic Mike franchise, which OK Magazine says Jenna thinks she's entitled to profits from. Dewan reportedly helped hire choreographers for a Magic Mike show and relocated so the family could be together while Channing was working.</p><p>Those details led Jenna to ask for part of the profits from the franchise, something Channing apparently isn't on board with. Or, at least, he wasn't happy with the ratio of the split that Jenna (and her team) requested.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's also possible there were other details yet to be resolved on the financial side of things.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Everything Jenna Dewan Has Done Since Her Divorce With Channing Tatum">Everything Jenna Dewan Has Done Since Her Divorce With Channing Tatum</a></span></p><p>At this point, it's still unclear how the court case ended; the two were meant to head to trial in June 2022 if an agreement wasn't met prior to that date. Other publications were reporting on the court case still raging on in September and November 2022.</p><p>As for the two finally-exes, today, <a href=#>Jenna is engaged to Steve Kazee</a>, whom she met in 2018. The two share one child together.</p><p>Channing has dated a few famous faces, including singer Jesse J for almost two years and Zoë Kravitz beginning in 2021. Though updates on Channing and Zoë's relationship are rare, it seems <a href=#>the two were still dating as of late 2022</a>; it's assumed they're together going into 2023.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdmLWius2ipaBlpJbBtrmMmqWdZZqau6%2BtjJ2csJmeYrWiwsRmmGaoopq7tryO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
