Spring! It’s a lovely season, but let’s be honest — it makes getting dressed a particularly complicated process. One day the weather calls for shorts, the next it calls for sweatpants… and the next it somehow calls for both? It’s a pain, especially if our closet doesn’t have enough room to stock every season’s clothes at the same time."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It’s a lovely season, but let’s be honest — it makes getting dressed a particularly complicated process. One day the weather calls for shorts, the next it calls for sweatpants… and the next it somehow calls for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">both</a>? It’s a pain, especially if our closet doesn’t have enough room to stock every season’s clothes at the same time.</p><p>This is where transitional pieces come in. Pieces that are light and breathable enough for warmer weather but long and cozy enough for colder weather. Pieces you could wear to the beach or for a movie night on the couch with some hot cocoa. Versatile, comfy finds you can wear pretty much whenever, wherever. You don’t have to imagine what that looks like though — you can just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy it on Amazon</a>!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><a href=# rel=nofollow class=shopping-button__link></a><p>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Qianxizhan High-Waist Boho Harem Pants</a> are number one bestsellers in their category, and they have tons of star-filled reviews on their Amazon page. It’s easy to see why! Their material is smooth, soft and lightweight, finding that perfect “in between” for fickle spring weather!</p><p>These harem-style pants have a high-rise silhouette with an ultra-wide smocked waistband. This design is stretchy, comfy and flattering. Meanwhile, the legs of the pants have a loose, relaxed fit, only gathering again at the ankle. The ankles are elasticized, creating a subtle lantern leg effect. And don’t forget to note those nice pockets at the sides of the thighs!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><a href=# rel=nofollow class=shopping-button__link></a><p>One of our favorite things we love to see while we’re shopping for new pieces is color options, and these pants seriously delivered. They come in a whopping 21 different colorways! There’s a small handful of plain shades like black, grey and wine red, plus a big variety of different boho-chic prints. You’ll find motifs like elephants, feathers, paisley and more!</p><p>On a regular, casual spring day, we might choose to wear <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">these pants</a> with a loose crop top, strappy sandals and a crossbody bag. If it were to cool down later in the day, we could switch to sneakers and slip on a cardigan or pull on a crew-neck sweatshirt. If the sun is shining extra strong the next day, we could wear them with a racerback tank and a claw clip in our hair. We could even wear them on a beach vacation with a bikini top and flip flops — or with a sports bra for yoga!</p><p>Whether you’re dressing them up or down, wearing them to warm up or cool off — these pants are so ready to make all of your spring dressing dreams come true!</p><a href=# rel=nofollow class=shopping-button__link></a><p><strong>Not your style?
