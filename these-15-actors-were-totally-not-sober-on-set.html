For some of the gorgeous women on our list, like Margot Robbie and Jennifer Lawrence, they found themselves in need for a little liquid courage before dropping their clothes to the floor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other actors, like Billy Bob Thornton or Anna Kendrick, may take on characters who themselves drink and damn it if they aren't going to be "authentic" in their performance. Which means that when you see two characters drinking it up in a Netflix series which we talk about, you can rest assured they're actually drinking.</p><p>While sometimes the usage of substances may have lead to a memorable performance, it also leads to some outrageous stories. Including one actor falling asleep while a girl was getting all up on his business!&nbsp;Though sadly, one co-star of Shia LaBeouf also learned he was an abusive asshole after he would get drunk on set repeatedly.</p><h2 id=olivia-wilde---drinking-buddies><strong>Olivia Wilde - Drinking Buddies</strong></h2><p>When you're on a movie called Drinking Buddies, you can perhaps understand that drinking was going to be a pretty big component of the movie and perhaps filming experience.</p><p>This was confirmed by one of the leads in the film, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Olivia Wilde</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We were hammered the entire movie because it was real beer because beer on that set was cheaper than water."</p><p>Though to be fair, it's not like any of the cast was really going to be hurting for money so that really just sounds like an excuse to drink beer (not that there's anything wrong with that!).</p><p>The authenticity clearly paid off with critics as it scored 83% on RottenTomatoes.</p><h2 id=jennifer-lawrence---passengers><strong>Jennifer Lawrence -&nbsp;Passengers</strong></h2><p>When it comes to two actors who America seems to not be able to get enough of, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Lawrence</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Pratt</a> would certainly fit the bill. So you can imagine they were excited to get to work together on the film&nbsp;Passengers&nbsp;that also featured some adult booty bumping from both characters.</p><p>But in order to get in the mood, alcohol turned out to be a necessity for Lawrence who found an unexpected hurdle for the scene</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“He was married. And it was going to be my first time kissing a married man, and guilt is the worst feeling in your stomach. And I knew it was my job, but I couldn't tell my stomach that… It was just very vulnerable. And you don't know what's too much... That was the most vulnerable I've ever been," said Lawrence along with the fact that she was "really really drunk."</p><p>We're sure Pratt's wife, fellow actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anna Faris</a> would have been understanding!</p><h2 id=daniel-radcliffe-harry-potter><strong>Daniel Radcliffe – Harry Potter</strong></h2><p>There are plenty of big movies on our list, but there might not be a bigger franchise than Harry Potter. But for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Radcliffe</a> when he was around 20 years old, the pressure that came with the franchise turned him into a recluse who would often turn to alcohol,</p><p>"People with problems like that are very adept at hiding it. It was bad. I don't want to go into details, but I drank a lot and it was daily – I mean nightly,"</p><p>Radcliffe went on to say,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I can honestly say I never drank at work on Harry Potter. I went into work still drunk, but I never drank at work. I can point to many scenes where I'm just gone. Dead behind the eyes."</p><p>Thankfully Radcliffe was able to clean his life around and allegedly quit drinking in August 2010.</p><h2 id=wesley-snipes-blade-3><strong>Wesley Snipes – Blade 3</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wesley Snipes</a> used to be a big-shot actor, but when you hear about his behavior on&nbsp;Blades 3&nbsp;perhaps you won't be missing him too much. It was reported by his co-stars that Snipes would spend the large majority of his time in his trailer while enjoying some marijuana.</p><p>To top it off, he decided communicating through post-it notes were acceptable. We suppose when you consider his character often wore sunglasses, perhaps it helped convince him that it was okay to be red-eyed!</p><p>Snipes also infamously fought with the director throughout the process including calling him racist</p><h2 id=lizzy-caplan---true-blood><strong>Lizzy Caplan - True Blood&nbsp;</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lizzy Caplan has no shortage of outstanding roles to her name. And while she may be snarky in&nbsp;Mean Girls,&nbsp;she found herself plenty flustered on the day of her first nude scene for the television series&nbsp;True Blood.</p><p>And given the nature of this list, you may not be shocked to hear that Caplan turned to vodka to quell her nerves</p><p>"I didn’t really have lines the first time. It was like 7 am in the morning and I was chugging vodka completely naked while a makeup artist I had just met was on her knees in front of me sponging my ass," said Caplan.</p><p>She also went on to say that she also informed cast and crew members on if they noticed they were "excited" following the scenes.</p><h2 id=carrie-fisher-star-wars><strong>Carrie Fisher – Star Wars</strong></h2><p>2016 had no shortage of beloved celebrities who passed away, but the one that may have impacted you the most may have been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Carrie Fisher</a>. Of course known for her role as Princess Leia, Fisher was also open about her drug usage - including while on-set!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We did cocaine on the set of [The] Empire [Strikes Back], in the ice planet. I didn't even like coke that much. It was just a case of getting on whatever train I needed to take to get high," said Fisher.</p><p>It may have been 'the ice planet', but we guess it was Fisher who was supplying the snow! Fisher also used cocaine during her time on the film The Blues Brothers.</p><h2 id=gucci-mane---springbreakers><strong>Gucci Mane - Springbreakers</strong></h2><p>This list is full of esteemed actors but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gucci Mane</a> who appears in the movie&nbsp;Springbreakers&nbsp;is definitely more known for his hip-hop career.</p><p>Which at the very least for Mane, also comes with a great deal of partying which made him an excellent candidate to play a character in the movie who parties it up.</p><p>However, upon the start of the scene - which included copious amounts of marijuana and perhaps other substances by Gucci - he decided that&nbsp;sleeping was a better option</p><p>“So we’re shooting the sequence, and as he is getting f***ed, I start to hear snores. He had literally passed out! And she was riding his d**k the whole time," said director Harmony Korine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Korine also stated that they filmed for 45 minutes!</p><h2 id=natalie-portman-and-mila-kunis---black-swan><strong>Natalie Portman And Mila Kunis - Black Swan</strong></h2><p>When it comes to perhaps the most steamy entry on our list, we're going to let you make up your mind. It is heavily reported in Hollywood that before <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Natalie Portman</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mila Kunis</a> got hot and heavy for Black Swan, that they made sure tequila was around.</p><p>But while you may love the idea of them being drunk and letting it all fly on camera, Kunis has shot down the rumor</p><p>"False! There was no tequila! Not sure where that rumor came from, but it's false. I don't think we could have done that scene if we were intoxicated."</p><p>Either way, we're sure you don't mind being reminded that there is a movie where Kunis and Portman hook up!</p><h2 id=margot-robbie---the-wolf-of-wall-street><strong>Margot Robbie - The Wolf Of Wall Street</strong></h2><p>While we are sure that you would be plenty flustered if you were standing in front of a naked <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Margot Robbie</a>, it was her that was the nervous one prior to filming a love scene with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Leonardo DiCaprio</a> in The Wolf of Wall Street.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thankfully she had some liquid courage on hand to help out</p><p>"I did three shots of tequila at like nine in the morning, right before doing it," said Robbie.</p><p>Robbie also admitted that it was the first time she had to film a full-on sex scene for a role, which perhaps helped add to her nerves.</p><h2 id=denise-richards-and-neve-campbell---wild-things><strong>Denise Richards And Neve Campbell - Wild Things</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Denise Richards</a> has no shortage of roles in which she may get your pulse running. However, we don't know if any compare to Wild Things where she locks lips with fellow stunner <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Neve Campbell</a>.</p><p>But prior to getting up close and personal with Campbell, the two ladies elected to lower their ambitions with the help of some alcohol</p><p>"Neve and I went into her trailer and shared a pitcher of margaritas before we did the scene. Neither of us had ever kissed another girl … Everyone has a first time," said Richards in a past interview.</p><h2 id=shia-labeouf---lawless><strong>Shia LaBeouf - Lawless</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shia LaBeouf</a> is known to be a dedicated method actor, but perhaps he took it a step too far when he decided to get hammered for his character in the movie Lawless. One person who wouldn't argue with you is his co-star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mia Wasikowska</a> who insinuated that LaBeouf was verbally abusive on-set as a result of his drinking moonshine.</p><p>"Moonshine is different than liquor. Moonshine is closer to heroin. Mia was ready to walk away from the movie. I was really pretty aggressive about it, and not in any kind of weird, strange way, but I don’t think she had ever experienced anything like that,” said LaBeouf.</p><p>Wasikowska later confirmed the stories in an interview.</p><h2 id=billy-bob-thornton---bad-santa><strong>Billy Bob Thornton - Bad Santa</strong></h2><p>When it comes to characters on this list that perhaps may not be the most shocking, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billy Bob Thornton</a>'s in Bad Santa may be at the top of the list. And when it came to playing a character who drinks on a regular basis, Thornton made sure that he too was getting hammered often</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I’ve traditionally played really extreme characters and even in a comedy, if you’re going to play a guy like this, you can’t be sort of drunk, you know? And I wasn’t sort of drunk. You have to go completely into it," said Thornton.</p><p>The role was previously offered to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jack Nicholson</a> but nobody would have played the role quite like Thornton!</p><h2 id=anna-kendrick---drinking-buddies><strong>Anna Kendrick - Drinking Buddies</strong></h2><p>The movie Drinking Buddies is so well-known for its "authenticity" on-set that we have multiple stories from the film make our list. While Olivia Wilde got used to the authenticity of the set from the very beginning, that wasn't the case for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anna Kendrick</a>.</p><p>Kendrick joined the project two weeks into filming, leading to a hilarious story which Wilde shared with a past interviewer</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"She’s about this big [indicating small] and she sat down to do the first scene and took a huge gulp of beer, not realizing it was real and was like instantly hammered. She was like, ‘What’s happening? What are you guys doing?’ and we were like, ‘Oh, we forgot to tell you – the beer’s all real and everyone’s drunk. It’s 10 a.m., Welcome to Drinking Buddies.’ ”</p><p>We're sure that was a much different day on set than Kendrick was expecting.</p><h2 id=ashton-kutcher-and-danny-masterson---the-ranch><strong>Ashton Kutcher And Danny Masterson - The Ranch</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashton Kutcher</a> is no stranger to the television screen. In fact, he's no stranger to hitting up the television alongside <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Danny Masterson</a>. The two rocked out on That 70's Show and have reunited for the Netflix series The Ranch.</p><p>Kutcher talked about the series on<i> Late Night With Seth Meyers </i>and after being told that it seems like they're really drinking, Kutcher responded "We're sh*tfaced most of the show. The funny thing is, me and Danny started maybe we'll have a beer during the scene and then we started bombing takes to get the other person drunk."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kutcher also implied that drinking was something that happened on Saturday Night Live, which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Meyers</a> (an SNL legend) smiled back.</p><h2 id=john-stamos---talk-show-mornings-with-kerri-anne><strong>John Stamos - Talk Show Mornings With Kerri-Anne</strong></h2><p>Now this one may be a television interview, but it's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John Stamos</a> and for Uncle Jesse we're willing to make an exception. When appearing on an Australian talk-show entitled Mornings with Kerri-Anne, Stamos clearly seemed out of sorts.</p><p>When his publicity team was asked about it, they said he was jet-lagged but Stamos was quick to own up to the truth</p><p>"I’ll be honest: When I went on that morning show, I was drunk. Yes, I was on sleeping pills and I was jet-lagged, but I was also just plastered. And I never said I wasn’t, but that whole Warner Bros. publicity machine got involved and said, 'Just say he was jet-lagged.' I said, 'No, tell ’em the truth! I was f**king drunk in Australia. Big deal.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWatoJWosm59lGaYnKyfp8Buw8SrnGasn6murbjYZqWorF2ovKOx0Wamp2WTlrqmvsBo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
