The storytelling is fabulous and believable. What can you share about your experiences filming the show?</strong></p><p><strong>Sammi Rotibi:</strong> I had an amazing experience shooting the second season of “Mars” because it was bigger, better, and more scripted. The production was incredible. They brought in Dee Johnson (ER, Nashville) as our showrunner and added two more awesome directors, Stephen Cragg and Ashley Way (Homeland), to join our already incredible director from the first season, Everardo Gout. And they added new cast members to our ensemble who just enhanced the story and journey. I can’t wait for the audience to go on this wild ride with us this season.</p><p><strong>Q: Do you and your character share any similarities?</strong></p><p><strong>Sammi Rotibi:</strong> I think Robert Foucault and I have a lot in common because he’s a visionary. A builder. An engineer. Always asking, how can I make humanity better, be a part of change? He’s forward thinking. Building a better future for all.</p><p><strong>Q: I saw a quote of yours on Twitter: “I never gave up, I always believed, I’ve always had faith that I would be successful one day.” What inspired you to become an actor?</strong></p><p><strong>Sammi Rotibi:</strong> Being on stage for the first time, performing in front of a large audience was one of the scariest experiences of my life. But also amazingly euphoric. Escaping into characters. EXCITING!!!</p><p><strong>Q: What other projects do you have in the works that you’re allowed to chat about?</strong></p><p><strong>Sammi Rotibi:</strong> I had a film come out in the summer for Fox, “The Darkest Minds”. And I just finished shooting a really cool indie called “The Obituary Of Tunde Johnson.”</p><p><strong>Q: Elon Musk said, “Getting to Mars would be the greatest adventure ever in human history.” If you had the chance to go to Mars, would you risk it?</strong></p><p><strong>Sammi Rotibi:</strong> If there’s a return ticket! To be honest…I don’t know. Maybe.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fqK6uuchmqaismZe2bq7IqJ6rmaCdxm6txp5kp52kYsSwvtOhZJ2ZpJ67qHnMqK2inaNk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
