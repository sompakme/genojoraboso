You are not judged, you are not criticized,” the Titanic star tells Freya — played by her real-life daughter, 22 — in <a href=# rel=noopener>a trailer for I Am Ruth</a>. “Well I am though, am I not?” Threapleton’s character replies.</p><p>Later in the teaser, Freya grows upset after <a href=#>her phone gets taken away</a>. “It’s what’s making you ill, sweetheart,” her mother tells her gently.</p><p>Winslet worked with the I Am… anthology series creator, <a href=#><strong>Dominic Savage</strong></a>, to develop the feature-length drama. The Mare of Eastttown alum has been outspoken about her distaste for social media in the past.</p><p>Speaking with the <a href=# rel=noopener>Sunday Times</a> in November 2015, the England native said of photo-sharing platforms: “It has a huge impact on young women’s self-esteem, because all they ever do is design themselves for people to like them. And what comes along with that? <a href=#>Eating disorders</a>. And that makes my blood boil and is the reason we don’t have any social media in our house.”</p><p>The Steve Jobs actress continued: “Let your kids climb trees. <a href=#>Take the device out of their hand</a>. Play Monopoly! You go to a cafe and grown-ups are at one end of the table and children the other, on devices, not looking up.”</p><p>During a July 2015 appearance on Running Wild With Bear Grylls, Winslet opened up about <a href=#>wanting her daughter to feel good in her own skin</a>.</p><p>“When I grew up, I never heard positive reinforcement about body image from any female in my life. I only heard negatives. That’s very damaging because then you’re <a href=#>programmed as a young woman to immediately scrutinize yourself</a> and how you look,” she said.</p><p>The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind actress then revealed one method she used to help Threapleton cultivate self-love.</p><p>“I stand in front of the mirror and say to Mia, ‘We are so lucky we have a shape. We’re <a href=#>so lucky we’re curvy</a>. We’re so lucky that we’ve got good bums.’ And she’ll say, ‘Mummy, I know, thank God.’ It’s paying off,” she said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>I Am Ruth is not the first time that the Academy Award winner <a href=#>has acted alongside her daughter</a>. In 2014, Threapleton appeared in the period drama A Little Chaos, which her mother starred in.</p><p>Scroll through for everything you need to know about Threapleton:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BitqJ506GpnpmgobK1u81mbGasmJ67qL%2BMraZmo56kxG6twaisrWWblsGmedaipayklanAbrDArp6hrJWnfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
