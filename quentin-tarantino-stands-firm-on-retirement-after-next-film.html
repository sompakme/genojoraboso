Though Maher was persistent in coxing Tarantino off the retirement ledge, the director was persistent in his stance on throwing in the towel.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Highest-Grossing Quentin Tarantino Movies, Ranked</a></span></p><p>"I don’t have a reason that I would want to say out loud that’s going to win any argument in a court of public opinion or Supreme Court or anything like that," the director continues to point out, "At the same time, working for 30 years doing as many movies as I’ve done, not as many as other people, that’s a long career. That’s a really long career. And I’ve given it everything I have. Every single solitary thing I have."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though he doubts his fate in the moviemaking business, he states in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the interview</a> that he still has one good one left in him. While he has yet to reveal anything that's set in stone, he&nbsp;toyed around&nbsp; with the idea of having his last film be a complete remake of&nbsp;<a href=#>Reservoir Dogs</a>,&nbsp;a tale of jewelry store heist mishaps starring&nbsp;Harvey Keitel, Chris Penn, and Tim Roth.</p><p>Though, when&nbsp;Maher brought the possibility of a remake up, Tarantino's response was, "That’s kind of a ‘capture time in a moment’ kind of thing.&nbsp;I won’t do it, internet. But I considered it."</p><p>Tarantino cites his decision to bow out of showbiz to the crippled careers of directors who he thinks should have called it a quits long before it was to late. He openly noted&nbsp;Escape from Alcatraz director&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Don Siegel</a> as a prime example. While he gave Siegel props for his early work, he found his final films&nbsp;Jinxed! and Rough Cut. to just not hold up to the same standard of cinematic excellence.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Die hard Tarantino fans will certainly be gutted to hear the news of his exit from Hollywood, but it seems like the director isn't budging from his long awaited retirement. Lucky for them, there's about thirty years of Tarantino flicks to binge long after he's halted his directorial run. From the legendary Kill Bill series to Pulp Fiction&nbsp;there's more than enough of Tarantino's brilliance to go around.</p><p>His highly decorated career has granted him a stunning net worth of $120 million and two Oscars awards for Best Original Screenplay. His most recent flick,&nbsp;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, made&nbsp;374.6 million in the box office and&nbsp;saw a whopping $20 million plopped into his bank account.</p><p><span class=next-single>Read Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>9 Top Money-Making Directors in Hollywood</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IndieWire</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS%2BtrHNraCnZaSWv6K606KlqGWjqa6vsNJmnaKqnWK%2FpsDIq5ymnZ6peqKy056pZqaVrcFussilpGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
