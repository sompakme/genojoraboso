At the post-show press conference, Heyman explained that the Bloodline story is <a href=#>only in the third inning</a>.</p><p>“We are just figuring this stuff out. We haven’t even hit our stride yet. If you want to take the arrogant approach, I’m sure <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Paul Levesque</a> will tell you all the box office records that have been smashed. Every Friday night when we show up at SmackDown, we’re always told, ‘this is the largest gate of this and the largest gate of that.’ ‘This is the largest premium live event.’ ‘This is the largest WrestleMania.’ Okay, we can sit there and point to what clearly drove all this, and it’s the Bloodline, and when I say the Bloodline, I mean the Tribal Chief <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Roman Reigns</a>.”</p><p>“There is so much more for us to master. It’s a craft, and it’s an evolving craft. It’s an ever evolving form of entertainment. If you sit there and you think, ‘we got this, this is it, we’re cruising to WrestleMania,’ we’re going to be replaced, and we should be. If you don’t come at this with the greatest ambitions to be much better tomorrow than you are today and much better two days from now, then you’re not here to be the greatest of all time.</p><p>“What inning are we in? Bottom of the third. Wait until you see what we have in the fourth.”</p><p>Catch up on our coverage of WWE SummerSlam <a href=#>here</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJyamxoZGK%2FprzOq6tmqJGquW60xLKkmqZdrK60utNmoKehpJ6urbjYZqqcoJWZwq2xw2adqKpdm7azv9Nmq5qjlWKusbzEmqmappOa</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
