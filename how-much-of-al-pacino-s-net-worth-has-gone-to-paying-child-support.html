As a result, Pacino has managed to accumulate a truly impressive fortune during his many years in Hollywood.</p><p>Already a father of <a href=#>three adult children</a> when his baby son was born in 2023, Al Pacino has been providing for his kids since 1989. Given Pacino's large net worth and how many children he has, that begs an obvious question. How much has he spent on child support?</p><h2 id=how-much-money-has-al-pacino-paid-in-child-support>How Much Money Has Al Pacino Paid In Child Support?</h2><p>In 2014, Al Pacino was interviewed by The New York Times about his life and career. During the resulting conversation, Pacino spoke about how his life was affected because his father left him when he was only two years old. “It’s the missing link, so to speak.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/al-pacino-sitting-on-a-bench.jpg><p>Based on Pacino's comment, it is clear that not having his father in the picture affected him deeply. While that is terrible for Pacino, the nice thing is he went on to explain that his own experiences made him <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">know that he wanted to be an involved father</a> in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the lives of his four children</a>.</p><p>“Having children has helped a lot. I consciously knew that I didn’t want to be like my dad. I wanted to be there. I have three children. I’m responsible to them. I’m a part of their life. When I’m not, it’s upsetting to me and to them."</p><p>Given that some celebrities notably have broken relationships with their children, it is wonderful that Pacino was there emotionally for his kids. Since Pacino was rich and famous, there was something else he could do for his children, support them financially.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Al Pacino's Ex Beverly D'Angelo Was Married When They Fell In Love: Here's Why Her Husband Was Actually Excited She Left Him</a></span></p><p>In 1989, Pacino's eldest child was born, Julie Pacino. Now in her early 30s, Julie Pacino has followed in her father's footsteps by becoming an actor and filmmaker. While a fair amount is known about the person Julia Pacino, her mother is much more of a mystery.</p><p>Aside from the fact that Pacino briefly dated Julie Pacino's mom Jan Tarrant, the only other thing that is known about her is she was an acting coach. After Julie Pacino was born, Pacino never had a publicly revealed custody or child support battle with Tarrant.</p><p>On the other hand, a lot more is known about Pacino's relationship with the mother of his two middle children. Part of the reason for that is the mother of Pacino's twins is a famous actor in her own right.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/al-pacino-s-ex-beverly-d-angelo-was-married-when-they-fell-in-love-here-s-why-her-husband-was-actually-excited-that-she-left-him.jpg><p>Best known as a major part of a beloved comedy franchise, Beverly D'Angelo played the matriarch of the Griswold from the Vacation movies. Some of D'Angelo's other notable credits include films like Coal Miner's Daughter, Hair, and American History X.</p><p>According to Whos Dated Who, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">D'Angelo and Pacino were a couple from 1997 until 2003</a>. In January 2001, D'Angelo gave birth to the twins that she shares with Pacino, Anton Pacino and Olivia Pacino.</p><p>Now that the twins are in their early 20s, Anton Pacino seems like he wants to stay out of the public eye. On the other hand, Olivia Pacino seems more open to the world since she has a social media presence where she has shared photos of herself with her father in the past.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Do Al Pacino's Kids Like His Much Younger Girlfriend, Noor Alfallah? Here's The Truth About Their Relationship With The Mother Of Their Youngest Sibling</a></span></p><p>In 2003, Entertainment Weekly published a report about how much support Pacino was paying. According to that report, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pacino paid $35,000 per month</a> at that time to fund the employment of four nannies and other childcare expenses.</p><p>After Pacino and D'Angelo split, they engaged in a legal battle over custody and child support that was bitter at that time. Roughly a year after Entertainment Weekly's aforementioned report, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the former couple came to an agreement</a> the details of which weren't publicly divulged.</p><p>By the time of Entertainment Weekly's report, Pacino and D'Angelo's twins were already two years old. If Pacino paid $35,000 a month to financially support his twins over 16 years, the total that would have cost him is $6.72 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/al-pacino-and-olivia-pacino-at-an-event-together-from-her-instagram-account.jpg><p>Given that Pacino and D'Angelo went on to battle in court over child support for a year after the $35,000 figure was reported, it seems very likely he paid more than that. After all, if Pacino was willing to pay that much at first, why would he pay lawyers to fight for a year if he was only asked to pay that much?</p><p>At the end of the day, there is no way for anyone other than Pacino to know exactly how much he has paid in child support. That said, given the $6.72 million figure and the fact that Pacino also would have paid child support for his eldest daughter, it seems very likely that he would have paid at least $10 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It also is worth noting that it is very easy to see how the final figure could be much higher than that. After all, Pacino could have agreed to up his child support payments as the years progressed without any information being reported in the media. It also is very possible that Pacino foot the bill for expenses related to his kids that fell outside his child support agreements.</p><h2 id=how-much-does-al-pacino-have-to-pay-noor-alfallah-in-child-support>How Much Does Al Pacino Have To Pay Noor Alfallah In Child Support?</h2><p>In June 2023, Al Pacino's youngest son Roman Pacino was born. 54 years younger than Pacino, Roman's mother is the film producer Noor Alfallah. By September 2023, there were a lot of rumors that Pacino and Alfallah were breaking up.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does Al Pacino's Kids Like His Much Younger Girlfriend, Noor Alfallah? Here's The Truth About Their Relationship With The Mother Of Their Youngest Siblin</a></span></p><p>As of the time of this writing, it has been reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pacino and Alfallah have formalized their custody agreement</a> for their son. However, Pacino's team has told the press that the famous actor and Alfallah are still a couple.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Based on the fact that Alfallah and Pacino have a formalized custody agreement, that may mean he has to pay child support already. Even if Pacino doesn't pay child support now, he will have to in the future if he and Alfallah ever do break up like the rumors said they were going to.</p><p>From the outside looking in, there is no way to know how much a parent pays in child support. The reason for that is there are so many factors that go into that decision including wealth, income, laws of the area the decision is made, and more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/does-al-pacino-s-kids-like-his-much-much-younger-girlfriend-noor-alfallah_-here-s-the-truth-about-their-relationship-with-the-mother-of-their-youngest-sibling.jpg><p>That said, it is possible to get an idea of the kind of money Pacino would likely pay in child support for Roman Pacino if it comes to that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In September 2023, it was reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin Costner was ordered to pay $63,000 per month in child support</a>. According to Celebrity Net Worth, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Costner has a $250 million fortune</a> which is a little bit more than double what that website says Pacino is worth.</p><p>Since Pacino reportedly is worth roughly half of what Costner is, it could be estimated that he would be ordered to pay $31,500 per month in child support. If Pacino paid that much for 18 years, it would cost him $6.804 million. That said, it is important to note that is only an educated guess and Pacino could be ordered to pay a lot more or less than that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIyao2aokZi2r7uMp5ytZaekv7W0jKmYsqGenHqktMilm2arpaW9sL7TaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
