It’s no secret that she’s got a&nbsp;fun side, a sensitive side, a broken side, and a side that likes to party. And because she is also so honest and up front about her problems and her issues, it’s also a reason why her fans love her so much and why her critics can’t categorize or box her. One day she’s a broken country star who is wearing her heart on her sleeve and before you know it, she’s a rockin’ pop star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While there’s no denying that Miranda Lambert has always been a huge star in her own right, it’s her divorce from Blake Shelton that has managed to blast all of her personal issues in the front headlines. And what happened after the ex-couple’s separation sure didn’t help make her situation any better. Once Blake began dating Gwen Stefani, the media turned it into a celebrity love triangle that has dominated the tabloid and gossip magazine headlines ever since. But that’s not all that’s happened. Here are 15 things that Miranda Lambert’s publicist is trying to hide about the star. Some of these secrets&nbsp;might truly surprise you.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=blake-shelton-left-her-heartbroken><strong>Blake Shelton Left Her Heartbroken</strong></h2><p>According to Miranda Lambert, her ex-husband Blake Shelton left her heartbroken by pulling the plug on their marriage. Sure, they had their problems, but she certainly didn’t expect their marriage to fall apart the way they did. After all, they were the country music scene’s golden couple. But one thing led to another, and before Miranda knew it, she was a single woman writing song lyrics about her broken heart for her upcoming album. And according to some critics, the songs turned out to be some of the best ones yet of her career.</p><p>According to Life and Style, Miranda has said, “Falling in love is awesome, but I'm never drawn to happy songs per se, so whenever you sit down to write a heartbreak song and you're happily in love, it's like, 'OK, now I have to go back to a sad place to get something good.”</p><h2 id=did-the-voice-get-in-the-way-of-their-marriage><strong>Did The Voice&nbsp;Get In The Way Of Their Marriage?</strong></h2><p>Of course, there are a lot of things that Miranda Lambert has said and done in the past that has gotten her to where she is today. According to a handful of reports, Miranda supposedly believes that Blake Shelton’s stint on the highly rated and popular reality competition show might have done something about the demise of their marriage. Apparently, Blake was getting too big for his britches. He was becoming a crossover star and according to insiders, Miranda simply couldn’t handle it. Being a country star was one thing, but being a huge television star was another.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Also, Miranda has never really a fan of the Idol-type and manufactured show.&nbsp;Taste of Country&nbsp;reports her as saying, “I think I find new idols every day&nbsp;– someone that says something really inspiring, is successful, has character.”</p><h2 id=she-addressed-all-the-rumors><strong>She Addressed All The Rumors</strong></h2><p>Now, none of this has ever been confirmed, but word on the street is that Miranda Lambert might or might not have been looking elsewhere&nbsp;during their short-lived marriage. Again, we don’t know that for sure. According to Extra TV, there have been some reports that have implied that Miranda had a roaming eye while she was still with Blake.</p><p>It’s no secret that Miranda has denied all of the rumors. She insists that she was always faithful to Blake throughout their marriage. Miranda wants everyone to believe she was a loyal wife. She has even said in the past to CMT.com, “So you treat your love like a firefly, like it only gets to shine for a little while. Catch it in a mason jar, with holes in the top, and run like hell to show it off.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-non-stop-partying><strong>Her Non-Stop Partying</strong></h2><p>Miranda Lambert is one country star who knows how to party, both on and off stage. After all, the woman is country music’s reigning vocalist. Also, there’s no VIP part she has never said no to. She’s a very social person and also likes to reach out to her fans and spends time with them. That’s why she makes quite an effort to stick around and make sure that she signs every last autograph and take every last picture with her die-hard fans. She’ll even have a drink or two at the bar if you invite her. That’s just the kind of person who Miranda is.</p><p>Brainy Quotes&nbsp;quotes her as saying in an interview, “My mom was always saying: 'Be whatever you want to be, but stick with it. Don't waver. Don't change who you are for anybody.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-private-issues><strong>Her Private Issues&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Miranda has made it no secret that she has issues with&nbsp;drinking. Now, don’t get us wrong, she’s not on her way to an AA meeting or anything, but she does like to drink her sorrows when she feels like it. After all, she is a woman with feelings and emotions that tend to get the best of her. We’ve all been in that same place at least one time during our lives. Also, she also has her own line of wine that just happens to reflect her Southern spirit.</p><p>According to Entertainment Tonight, she has explained in the past, “I think the more emotional you are, the better. I'm sort of writing [songs] as I go and I can never tell how it's going to be or how it's going to feel until I get into the studio. But I definitely think it will. I probably can't help but have the emotions in my voice.”</p><h2 id=her-reported-health-issues><strong>Her Reported Health Issues</strong></h2><p>When it comes to Miranda Lambert, she has nothing to hide. She doesn’t have the same kind of secrets that other celebrities have. What you see is ultimately what you get. But she’s had her fair share of health issues and scares in the past, too. In fact, she was forced to cancel her concert appearances after she battled with a “serious inflammation of her vocal records” according to reports back in 2015.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Also, she’s gone up and down with her weight, too and isn’t afraid to talk about it. She told People Magazine, “I don’t care about being stick-thin. I don’t want stuff to jiggle. Really skinny actresses make me hungry—I see them and think, Honey, you need to eat! I’m lucky I don’t have to live like that. I feel my best when I’m a toned, not flabby, size 8. Women come up to me and say, ‘You’re beautiful and confident, and that makes me feel I can be, too.’”</p><h2 id=is-she-jealous-of-gwen-stefani><strong>Is She Jealous Of Gwen Stefani?</strong></h2><p>For years now, there has been a love triangle between Miranda Lambert, her ex-husband and his now long-term girlfriend, Gwen Stefani. A lot of people have even pointed out that Miranda might have felt jealous of Gwen, just because Blake began his relationship soon after he broke up with Miranda. The timing couldn’t be any worse. During a time in which she was mending her broken heart, she was forced to read, see and listen to other people talk about how much in love Blake and Gwen were. If that weren’t enough, Blake even credited Gwen from “saving him” from the depression he felt during his marriage to Miranda.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>E! Online reports Miranda as saying, “I definitely still have... angst but I also wrote some songs that say it's okay to love, now. I'm happy in my life, and it's a bit easier to write happy songs when you are actually happy.”</p><h2 id=she-is-diligent-about-protecting-herself><strong>She&nbsp;Is Diligent About Protecting Herself&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Now, this shouldn’t surprise anyone. Miranda Lambert is a woman who is from the South, a true Texan at heart, and above all a passionate and patriotic American. She is who she says she is and she doesn’t make any apologies about it. She’s also someone who is not afraid to admit that she carries a concealed weapon when she needs to. She doesn’t talk about it often, but it’s something that is very important to her. Being a singer in the celebrity spotlight, she also knows that her safety is a huge concern and that she doesn’t want to take any chances, especially in public.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to E! Online, she once said on the red carpet, “I carry a weapon. I got a threat a few years ago and was really scared. But I don't want bodyguards. I am my own security.”</p><h2 id=but-she-does-set-boundaries><strong>But She Does Set Boundaries</strong></h2><p>While Miranda isn’t afraid to admit that she carries a concealed weapon in public, if there’s one thing she won’t do, it’s get involved in politics. That’s where she sets her boundaries. While there are a lot of country music stars who have either leaned to the left or to the right, Miranda refuses to give her support to one candidate or the other. She simply doesn’t want to get into that kind of arena, knowing how messy and complicated things get, much to the disappointment of some of her fans.</p><p>She’s said according to Us Weekly, “I have my views and obviously my music has connotations that lean toward what I believe, but I've learned through other artists' mistakes that I'm never going to use my career as a platform for politics, especially at shows. People come to hear music. It's my job to entertain them, and it's my escape too.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-public-breakdowns><strong>He Public Breakdowns</strong></h2><p>Soon after her separation from Blake Shelton was announced, Miranda had a few very emotional breakdowns on stage and in front f her fans. And they certainly weren’t easy to watch. Miranda made it pretty clear that she was hurting and that she didn’t expect her divorce from Blake to affect her the way it did. What’s more, she also hit the bottle more than usual, and is something that she’s even admitted too.</p><p>CMT reports her as saying, “I think the more emotional you are, the better. I'm sort of writing [songs] as I go and I can never tell how it's going to be or how it's going to feel until I get into the studio. But I definitely think it will. I probably can't help but have the emotions in my voice.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-wears-her-heart-on-her-sleeve><strong>She Wears Her Heart On Her Sleeve</strong></h2><p>Regardless of all the things that have been written about Miranda Lambert, she is one country singer who likes to wear her heart on her sleeve. While there are some country music stars who dare wouldn’t say or admit the things that Miranda has done, she simply doesn’t care. When she’s hurt, you better believe that she’ll tell you about it. The same applies when she’s happy and living her best life, too.</p><p>According to Brainy Quotes, she said, “I just feel like it's easier to co-write sometimes, especially if you have chemistry with somebody. It kind of takes all the pressure off of you. But, you know, I started writing songs by myself. I didn't really have a co-writer, besides my dad. When I see a record and it has a song on it that someone wrote [alone], I just really believe in them as a writer. I feel like it's a window into them, more than it is if you write a song with someone else.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-lyrics-say-it-all><strong>Her Lyrics Say It All</strong></h2><p>In true country music style, Miranda Lambert’s lyrics say it all. In fact, she’s written several songs about Blake Shelton and the breakdown of her marriage. And for her publicist, she might have gone too far one too many times. Some things should just be kept private, right? Well, not according to Miranda. If you did her wrong, you better bet your last dollar that she will tell the world about it. It’s no wonder Blake Shelton often hides his face whenever Miranda has something to say.</p><p>She said in an interview with People Magazine, “I think being a Texan–we sort of have that extra fire in us as a breed. I just felt like from day one I had something to say and I wanted to make sure people heard me, and it's worked.”</p><h2 id=she-doesn-t-hold-back><strong>She Doesn’t Hold Back</strong></h2><p>A lot of critics have said that Miranda Lambert is the kind of person who likes to pack an emotional punch. She’s also one that can deliver powerful, crown-pleasing show. In other words, she’s not all fluff like Gwen Stefani. It’s no wonder that her fans often get very excited about her concerts and performances, simply because she doesn’t hold back. She’s great entertainment, both professionally and personally speaking, if you know what we mean. And for her publicist, it’s also a reason why she needs to be kept on her toes all the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Also, when Miranda lets the crazy out, she lets all of the crazy out. There’s just no stopping her! Life and Style Weekly reports that Miranda joked, “Currently I'm not a crazy ex-girlfriend, but I can't promise I won't be one again.”</p><h2 id=her-honest-approach-to-her-fans><strong>Her&nbsp;Honest Approach To Her Fans</strong></h2><p>While there are a lot of things that can be said about Miranda Lambert, her direct and honest approach to life and love is one of the reasons why her fans love her so much. She has also credited her fans for being some of the most loyal people in the music industry. And we believe it. Right after she separated from Blake, she had one of the best selling albums of her career. Her publicist might not like it whenever she reveals too much, but it’s done her career a whole lot of good. And not every artist can say that.</p><p>According to CMT, she’s said, “Country music fans are extremely passionate and loyal. It seems that country artists have longer-lasting careers because the fans stick with the artists through thick and thin.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-hacked-email-account><strong>Her Hacked Email&nbsp;Account</strong></h2><p>Several years ago it was reported that Miranda Lambert’s private email was hacked. In Touch Weekly reported that a hacker had access to at least 35,000 of her personal emails. And a lot of what the hacker found contained information about her broken marriage to Blake and their impending divorce. Miranda has never made any comments about the ordeal, but it was surely an embarrassing moment, for both her and her publicist and team.</p><p>But then again, Miranda isn’t the kind of person to shy away from the truth, no matter how ugly it gets: “I want to look my best, but I'm not a model. I'm not an actress. I'm representing normal girls. It's OK to have a little bit of curve. I'm happy with my body. So many girls come up to me and say, "Thank you for being normal," and I'm proud of that.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhpZWLBqbXNoKpmpZmnrq%2BwwGajmqWSmr%2B1v4yprJukmZi2tMCMsKaupJSjwW7DwKerZqCVp3q1u4ysn5qqlWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
