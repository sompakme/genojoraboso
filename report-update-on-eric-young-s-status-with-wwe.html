Young left IMPACT after he was “killed off” on-screen when Deaner stabbed him on the December 1 episode of IMPACT Wrestling.</p><p>Sean Ross Sapp of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fightful Select</a> reports that Young is under contract with WWE, and he has been since November, but he hasn’t appeared on-screen in any capacity as of this writing. Sapp wrote that there has been no word on Young being backstage at WWE shows during the period in which he has been signed.</p><p>The report notes that Triple H and his regime recruited Young after he took over in the summer of 2022, following Vince McMahon’s retirement. Young previously spent a few years with WWE; he was the leader of SAnitY, and he had a brief singles run. WWE released Young in a wave of cuts in April 2020, and he returned to IMPACT in July that same year.</p><p>WrestleZone will provide more information as it becomes available.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJva3BxYGK%2FprzOq6tmnaKesG7Fzq6loGWYlsBursSepWatnpmys3nWsJxmm5%2BjwbOtwq1krKGemLJufo9raQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
