Nothing is as popular as&nbsp;Home Alone, though, as the story of a young boy's family&nbsp;abandoning him over Christmas when they accidentally leave for the airport without him is still so charming and funny. Kevin McAllister thinks that he's won the lottery as he can eat junk food for dinner (like a massive sundae, his favorite). Of course, things aren't that easy and he also has to fight off some truly bad guys.</p><p>Macaulay Culkin became a wealthy child star, and before he took a break from Hollywood, what was he paid for this iconic holiday film?</p><h2 id=a-100-000-paycheque>A $100,000 Paycheque</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Pesci is perfect as a criminal in Home Alone</a>&nbsp;and fans are eager for stories about this family-friendly film.</p><p>Macaulay Culkin was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">paid $100,000 to star in Home Alone</a>. According to&nbsp;Express.co.uk, he made quite a lot more for the sequel,&nbsp;Home Alone 2: Lost In New York, as he was paid $4.5 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Kevin-In-Home-Alone.jpg><p>Culkin has a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth of $18 million</a>. According to&nbsp;Celebrity Net Worth, he stopped acting at the end of the 1990s but while he was a working child actor, he was among the stars who were getting paid the most.</p><p>Before&nbsp;Home Alone, he was paid $40,000 for the movie&nbsp;Uncle Buck, which was written and directed by John Hughes and came out in 1989. He was paid $1 million for the tearjerker&nbsp;My Girl which was released in 1991, and his&nbsp;pay kept going up, as he was paid $8 million for the movies&nbsp;Ri¢hie Ri¢h&nbsp;and&nbsp;Getting Even With Dad, both released in 1994. That's a huge amount of money for a child to make.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>An Esquire&nbsp;story about Culkin from February 2020 talks about how his trust fund was said to be between $15 million and $20 million when he was a child, and because his parents were splitting up and trying to get custody of the children, it was a huge mess. He shared, "I legally took my parents’ names off of my trust fund and found an executor, someone who would look over my finances." He continued, "Look, I mean, it sucks. But: It coulda been worse, you know?"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth Behind Michael Jackson And Macauley Culkin’s Relationship</a></span></p><h2 id=culkin-s-thoughts-on-acting>Culkin's Thoughts On Acting</h2><p>Since Culkin took a break from acting, it's interesting to think about what he really thinks about this creative endeavor since so much has been said about him taking a step away from Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He shared with&nbsp;Esquire&nbsp;that the way he thinks about acting is like the movie&nbsp;The Shawshank Redemption. He said, "I enjoy acting. I enjoy being on set. I don’t enjoy a lot of the other things that come around it." He continued that the character has to "crawl through a tube" of horrible stuff to leave prison. He says that he wants "freedom" but he has to deal with some not so great things before that. He explained, "And you know what? I’ve built a really nice prison for myself. It’s soft. It’s sweet. It smells nice. You know? It’s plush.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Joe Rogan And Macaulay Culkin Believe Happened To Johnny Depp</a></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Kevin-Home-Alone.jpg><p>In 2018, Culkin went on&nbsp;The Ellen DeGeneres Show and said about his status as a former child star, “I felt like some kid worked really, really hard and I inherited all of his money.

I can do all kinds of projects that I want to do.“</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to&nbsp;Indiewire, Culkin participated in an AMA on Reddit and shared that he likes&nbsp;Home Alone&nbsp;rather than the sequel. He said,&nbsp;“The first one was more fun because we didn’t know what we were walking into and it was a lot less flying all over the place. It was all in Chicago."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Macaulay Culkin Posts Epic Home Alone Throwback And Fans Have Mixed Reactions</a></span></p><p>Today, Culkin is 40 years old and according to&nbsp;Esquire, in a serious relationship with actress Brenda Strong.
