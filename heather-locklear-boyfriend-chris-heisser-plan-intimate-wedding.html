At the time, speculation was rife among fans following photos of the actress wearing a diamond ring on her left hand.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Heather-Locklear-and-Boyfriend-Chris-Heisser-Plan-Intimate-Wedding-2.jpg><p>The pair are high school sweethearts. Their relationship dates back to the ’70s, though they did not reunite until 2017.</p><p>Locklear was previously married to <a href=#><strong>Tommy Lee</strong></a> from 1986 to 1993 and <a href=#><strong>Richie Sambora</strong></a> from 1994 to 2007. She shares 23-year-old daughter <strong>Ava</strong> with Sambora, 61. She was also engaged to <a href=#><strong>Jack Wagner</strong></a> in 2011.</p><p>Locklear and Heisser have had their ups and downs along the way. In 2018, police were called to the Perfect Man star’s house several times in response to alleged domestic incidents between her and Heisser. In February of that year, Locklear was <a href=#>arrested for domestic violence</a>.</p><p>At the time, a spokesperson for the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office told Us there was “evidence that she had battered her boyfriend” during a dispute. She claimed in a search warrant obtained by Us that Heisser choked her and “<a href=#>stopped her from breathing.</a>” He was never charged. That same year Locklear was placed on a <a href=#>5150 psychiatric hold</a> after allegedly assaulting Heisser.</p><p>Us confirmed the duo <a href=#>called it quits</a> in 2019 but they later got back together.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Dynasty alum sought treatment for addiction early in her relationship with Heisser. She completed a 30-day rehab stint in October 2019 after being arrested the year before following an incident in which an emergency medical technician and police officer <a href=#>were allegedly assaulted</a>.</p><p>With reporting by Diana Cooper.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahnZGptaa%2BjKWmnKOcmq6zecGosJ%2BqmZq7pXnCoamiq12dsqq%2F0p6pZqiclrtutc2toKaZpJp6uLHDnaCnn18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
