You have the intention where you’re just like, ‘Yeah, let’s do this.’”</p><p>Brandon admitted that sometimes “life gets in the way,” but the siblings “plan” on having their little ones get together more often in the future.</p><p>Brandon is the son of <strong>Caitlyn Jenner</strong> and her ex-wife <strong>Linda Thompson</strong>. Caitlyn, 74, and Thompson, 73, also share son <strong>Brody Jenner</strong>. Caitlyn shares <strong>Burt Jenner</strong> and <strong>Casey Jenner</strong> with ex-wife C<strong>hrystie Scott</strong>.

He also shared that his little ones get to see their grandparents, including Caitlyn, who has the nickname Boom Boom.</p><p>“It’s a win all around, makes the grandparents happier, it makes the parents happier. They have that little bit of relief,” Brandon explained. “And the kids benefit greatly from being around grandparent energy, even though they’re not doing everything exactly the way the parents might want them to do it all the time. But grandparents, it’s a needed energy for kids.”</p><p>While Brandon confessed he and Caitlyn had a rocky relationship in the past, the pair are <a href=#>“very close” now</a> and talk “almost every day.”</p><p>As Brandon and Cayley raise their kids, they’ve adopted a plant-based lifestyle, which they explore in At Home With the Jenners.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I think it became important to me to kind of instill in our kids at a young age the importance of eating a more plant-based diet, getting away from animal products and therefore supporting factory farming,” Cayley told Us, noting she’s been plant-based for most of her adult life. “And it’s been kind of a fun journey. It’s been challenging at times, but I feel inspired and mostly we just try to have fun with it, keep it light.”</p><p>The first three episodes of <a href=#>At Home With the Jenners</a> are available to stream on UnChainedTV with more coming this summer.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGabqpGjsbC6jKOcp6aVp3q0rdisZK2gkal6qbXSZpqhoZyZv6a6jKGYr51dorK1ecqyo6KdXZ%2Byr7rEq6pmo5mZwHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
