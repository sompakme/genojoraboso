People make up stories about famous stars and there is no rhyme or reason to them. Unfortunately, there are some stars who seem to be targeted more than others. For example, there have been many <a href=#>fake articles about Justin Bieber dying</a> over the years.</p><p>Before fans found out that <a href=#>Blues Clues host Steve Burns quit</a> the beloved children's TV show because he was losing his hair, there were a lot of rumors that he had died. It was devastating to think that the kind-hearted TV host had passed away... but none of these stories turned out to be true. Here's what fans should know about the Steve Burns death rumors and whether he said anything about them.</p><h2 id=did-steve-burns-from-blues-clues-die>Did Steve Burns From Blues Clues Die?</h2><p>When Blues Clues premiered on Nickelodeon in 1996, it seemed like the perfect kids' show and Steve Burns seemed like the perfect host. In every episode, Steve solves a mystery with the help of his adorable dog Blue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blue-s-clues-host-steve-burns-was-battling-depression-during-the-show-but-managed-to-stay-positive-on-screen.jpg><p>Those who were kids during the '90s and watched Blues Clues regularly remember the charming and catchy songs and the fun, colorful set. It was tough to think that the show could ever exist without the amazing host.</p><p>Sadly, after a few episodes that aired in April 2002, Burns was gone. Donovan Patton took over as Joe, who was Steve's sibling.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/untitled-design-56.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Steve Burns From Blue's Clues Opens Up About His Depression While On The Show</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>While Steve might have seemed happy and charismatic as the host of Blue's Clues, his reality off-screen was drastically different.</span><p>Once he stopped hosting Blues Clues, Steve Burns became the unfortunate subject of fake death rumors. According to The Daily Mail, people said that he was in a car that crashed. They also said that he had been abusing substances.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The publication mentioned that Burns' mother read that he had passed away and phoned him. She was understandably emotional. It's definitely unfair that she had to worry about him when nothing had actually happened.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/How-The-Blues-Clues-Guy-Really-Spends-His-Sizable-Net-Worth-(steven-Michael-burns).jpg><p>Since Burns became incredibly private all of a sudden, it seems that some people assumed that he had died, and that's why these rumors happened. It was definitely an odd reaction to have, though. While fans were surprised that no one heard anything from him for a while, it was wrong to assume that he had passed away.</p><p>While some Blues Clues fans must have read these rumors online, it seems like others heard the rumors from classmates. There are countless posts on Reddit about how people were told by their peers at school that something horrible had happened to Burns. Some of the rumors were particularly awful and gruesome.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/why-fans-thought-steve-from-blues-clues-died-the-truth-about-the-fake-rumors.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How The Duggar Family Deals With Death Hoaxes And Rumors</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Which Duggar family members have died, and how does the family deal with the rumors and hoaxes surrounding their passing?</span><p>In 2022, Steve Burns was interviewed by several publications, and fans learned more about his decision to step away from the TV show that made him so famous. By then, it was of course very clear that he was alive, and fans were relieved and happy to hear from him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/steve-burns-nature.jpg><p>Considering the fact that <a href=#>Blues Clues host Burns struggled with depression</a>, the rumors about him dying seem particularly terrible in hindsight. As The Daily Mail reported, his mother was concerned, and it's easy to imagine that his family and friends were upset to hear these stories as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-blues-clues-star-steve-burns-talk-about-the-rumors-about-his-death>Did Blues Clues Star Steve Burns Talk About The Rumors About His Death?</h2><p>Steve Burns has talked about these death rumors in quite a few interviews. It makes sense that he would want to share his thoughts on the topic since it must be strange for him to read these fake stories time and time again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/How-The-Blues-Clues-Guy-Really-Spends-His-Sizable-Net-Worth-(steven-Michael-burns).jpg><p>In 2007, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Steve Burns talked about the rumors</a> in an interview with MTV. He explained that, of course, he wasn't happy that people shared such dark stories... particularly since he was the public face of Blues Clues, which is an adorable and innocent TV series.</p><p>Burns said, "I think the dissonance of that is really satisfying, you know, the idea that a children's television show host would be involved in such nefarious activities. It's overwhelmingly satisfying if you're 14. But that actually is the only thing that upsets me about the rumor. I just hate the idea of 'Blue's Clues' being associated with anything like that. We just all worked way too hard on it. But what are you going to do?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/steve-burns.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How The Blue's Clues Guy Really Spends His Sizable Net Worth</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Steven Michael Burns made an absolute fortune as the star of Blue's Clues, here's how he enjoys his money...</span><p>Burns also said, "It's starting to concern me. I'm starting to think that maybe there's something that people know that I don't know ... like that I'm dead! But I feel fantastic. I think I'm going to just make a Web site and actually affirm the rumor, and see if that helps. That way, I can at least die of something better than a drug overdose. I want to die in a whaling accident in Nova Scotia or something more interesting."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/steve-from-blues-clues-instagram-reveals-the-truth-about-his-secretive-personal-life-copy.jpg><p>Thankfully, Steve Burns has been doing well for a while now. In the last few years, he has connected with the people who loved watching him on Blues Clues and still think of him fondly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In September 2022, he shared a photo of himself standing on a stage at the FanXSalt Lake Comic Convention. He sounded incredibly thankful to have the support of his fanbase and wrote in the caption of the post, "Hard to express how wonderful it has been continuing the conversation with all of you. Feels like talking to an old friend."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In 2023, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Blues Clues host was at FAN EXPO Philadelphia</a> and participated in a panel. He shared wisdom about his career and answered questions from fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Watching the video of this panel on YouTube is a fun and moving experience for any Blues Clues fan. It's clear that Steve Burns loves his fans as much as they appreciate him. One fan told him that while people often give the advice that meeting heroes is a bad idea because they are disappointing, Burns is "the exception" because he's always so kind and wonderful.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>When speaking to a fan about the magic and duty of TV that is aimed at kids, Burns said something that was both surprising and fascinating. He said, "If you really want to make media for kids, I would get away from the idea of television... and move more into something that can be actually interactive, you know what I mean? More of the gaming space as it pertains to education."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdm66vv4ytn6itl53Bbr%2FTnq2eZZanvK55waWsnqtdmLm2sdJmm6KdlGKzorfEZqmupZ%2BnwHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
