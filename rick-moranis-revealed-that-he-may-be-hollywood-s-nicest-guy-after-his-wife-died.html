For example, SCTV starred John Candy, Martin Short, Catherine O’Hara, Eugene Levy, and Rick Moranis.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Martin Short Has Said About His Time On 'SNL'</a></span>After leaving SCTV behind, Rick Moranis became a major movie star. After all, Moranis starred in many extremely successful movies including Honey, I Shrunk the Kids which was a huge hit even though <a href=#>Disney was worried because it was penned by a horror writer</a>. Sadly for Moranis’ devoted fans, the beloved actor wound up disappearing after years of success. As it turns out, Moranis’ Hollywood absence just goes to prove why he may be the nicest guy in Hollywood history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-rick-moranis-sacrificed-his-hollywood-career>Why Rick Moranis Sacrificed His Hollywood Career</h2><p>In this day and age, there are loads of people who can be described as celebrities at any given time, whether they are famous actors, athletes, musicians, influencers, or something else. With that in mind, at times it can seem like being a celebrity isn’t as special as it once was. In reality, however, everyone who has become famous has overcome truly mind-numbing odds to get to that place. As a result, it makes sense that people love to read about the crazy ways stars became famous.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Doja Cat Become Famous Entirely By Accident?</a></span></p><p>After spending years jumping through hoops to become famous, stars then have to start the neverending battle to remain in the public eye. In fact, there are many examples of <a href=#>stars not being willing to accept they aren’t famous anymore</a> even though that fact is obvious to everyone else. On the other end of the spectrum, Rick Moranis once voluntarily walked away from fame and fortune and in recent years, the beloved actor has been happy to talk about no longer being a star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From 1983 until 1997, Rick Moranis starred in one classic film after another. For example, Moranis was an unforgettable part of movies like Strange Brew, Ghostbusters, Little Shop of Horrors, Spaceballs, and many more. Since 1997, aside from lending his voice to a trio of projects, Moranis hasn’t been a part of any movies. At the time that Moranis left the public eye, most people had no idea why he walked away. When he spoke to USA Today in 2005, however, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Moranis revealed the incredibly admirable reason his acting career stopped</a> out of nowhere.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I pulled out of making movies in about '96 or '97. I'm a single parent, and I just found that it was too difficult to manage raising my kids and doing the traveling involved in making movies. So I took a little bit of a break. And the little bit of a break turned into a longer break, and then I found that I really didn't miss it.”</p><p>For anyone unfamiliar with the story of Rick Moranis’ life, it may seem strange that being a single parent suddenly mattered to the actor in the late-‘90s. However, Moranis prioritizing his kids at that moment makes perfect sense. After all, Moranis only became a single parent when his wife died of cancer in 1991.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Rick Moranis’ wife and the mother of his kids passed away in 1991, he continued to work consistently for a few years. However, it is important to note that movie stars like Moranis almost always have years’ worth of projects lined up in advance. As a result, Moranis had almost certainly already signed on to most of the projects he made right after his wife’s passing. Then, from 1995 until 1997, Moranis only starred in two movies before he decided to walk away from Hollywood.</p><p>In an ideal world, every parent would put their kids’ welfare above everything else in terms of importance. If the world actually was like that, Rick Moranis’ decision to walk away from Hollywood to be there for his kids would be unremarkable. In reality, however, the truth of the matter is there are a lot of people in Hollywood who care more about their careers than anything else. With that in mind, the fact that Moranis spent years at home raising his kids when he could have been a rich and famous movie star says a lot about who he is as a person.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=more-proof-that-rick-moranis-is-a-really-nice-guy>More Proof That Rick Moranis Is A Really Nice Guy</h2><p>Of course, someone can be a loving and caring parent while at the same time being a jerk to everyone else in their life. However, based on all of the available evidence, it seems very clear that Rick Moranis is a great guy to everyone. For example, during Moranis’ acting career, Rick worked with a lot of the same actors over and over again. If Moranis was difficult to work with, that certainly wouldn’t have been the case.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>20 Actors Who Were Total Jerks On Set</a></span></p><p>On top of lots of stars being enthusiastic to work with Rick Moranis over and over, it is noteworthy that none of the actor’s past co-stars have had anything bad to say about him in the press. In fact, when Moranis wound up in the headlines in 2020, his peers had his back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On October 1st, 2020, Rick Moranis was walking in New York City when someone suddenly assaulted the actor completely unprovoked. When footage of that person punching Moranis in the face out of nowhere showed up on social media, actors like Chris Evans and Josh Gad expressed their outrage at what happened to Moranis. As anyone familiar with Hollywood will already know, there is a lot of gossiping. With that in mind, if Moranis had a reputation as a jerk in Hollywood, his fellow actors would be less likely to be outraged for him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipopubYrqwvsCnoKxlp56zpnnDnpitoF2staLAjKGYqaiVo7Klew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
