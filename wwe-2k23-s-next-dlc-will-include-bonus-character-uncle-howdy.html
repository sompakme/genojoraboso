The first big wrestling game without WWE branding for a very long time.

On July 19, the Revel with Wyatt pack will become available. Headlined by Bray Wyatt, the pack will also include Zeus, Valhalla, Joe Gacy, and Blair Davenport. Plus one more bonus character, as confirmed by 2K on Thursday.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Harley Race Joins A WWE Game For The First Time Via Latest 2K23 DLC</a></span></p><p>WWE Games tweeted a screenshot of Uncle Howdy, informing players they'll never be able to hide from him. That prompted quite a few people to ask if Wyatt's sidekick, who has been absent from TV for months will be playable. “Uncle Howdy is in fact a bonus playable character for DLC 4,” 2K replied.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=in-the-game-but-not-on-the-show>In The Game, But Not On The Show</h2><p>While not confirmed, the implication here is that Howdy will be an entirely separate character that is a part of the next pack, and not simply a reskinned version of Wyatt. Although neither Howdy nor Wyatt has been featured on WWE TV since before WrestleMania, making them separate characters in 2K23 makes sense. Having Howdy as an alternative look for Wyatt would imply the mysterious helper is just Wyatt in yet another mask.</p><p>That would be confusing for a number of reasons. Primarily because Wyatt and Howdy have appeared on TV together. The belief is that <a href=#>it's actually a returning Bo Dallas</a>, Wyatt's real-life brother, under the mask. 2K also didn't clarify whether you will need to own the season pass or buy the pack to get Howdy, or if <a href=#>he will be added for free like Candice LeRae</a> and Mia Yim were.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmenrLJufspramamla3BbrDLnGSippOhwqWxjJump62jYrCprdGamq2domLCr6%2FLnmShp6eZxnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
