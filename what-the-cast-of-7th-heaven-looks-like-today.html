Most TV shows don’t get a run like that, but despite the conservative storyline, it was a very popular show. The show aired between 1996-2007, and it was considered to be the longest-running family series on TV.</p><p>The story involved a pastor and his family, and the ups and downs that went along with being the children of a pastor. There were seven children in the family, so it left the opportunity for a lot of drama as the kids grew up to be teenagers on the show. The show originally was supposed to be canceled after the tenth season, but because they had such a cult following, the CW&nbsp;retained the show for an eleventh season.</p><p>The show was so popular that it was responsible for launching the career of one major actress. Though we all loved the characters on the show, they had some pretty wild things going on in their lives while on the show that caused major scandals. These scandals were not appreciated by the CW, especially since the show was Christian-based. Some of these scandals permanently affected the stars, while others went away.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you've ever wondered what happened to your favorite characters from 7th Heaven, then we have all the answers for you. Find out where your favorite stars are today.</p><h2 id=beverley-mitchell-sings-country-music><strong>Beverley Mitchell Sings Country Music</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beverley Mitchell</a> is one actress that never had one scandal the whole time she was on the show. In fact, she’s never done anything scandalous. She was actually discovered as a child actor at the age of 4 when an agent saw her throwing a tantrum in the mall. She played the always chipper Lucy Camden. She was a good kid who ended up growing up to be a minister on the show as well, following in her father’s footsteps. She avoided the child star curse and went on to land major roles in movies such as Saw II and TV shows such as The Secret Life of the American Teenager and Hollywood Darlings. She's consistently worked in Hollywood since the end of 7th Heaven and even went on to record her own country music album. It’s hard to believe that she went on to have a music career, but the young girl did quite well for herself over the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=catherine-hicks-stands-by-her-castmates><strong>Catherine Hicks Stands by Her Castmates</strong></h2><p>Catherine Hicks played the pastor’s wife and the busy mother of seven. She's been in the industry for a long time, getting her big break on a soap opera, Ryan’s Hope, in 1976. She even once played the sexy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marilyn Monroe</a> in the movie Marilyn: The Untold Story in 1980. Since 7th Heaven ended, she was never again in anything major. She's consistently worked in the industry, but it’s been one TV movie after another, and we haven’t seen her in anything since 2016. Her claim to fame was playing the mother in Child’s Play. She even ended up marrying the man who designed the creepy Chucky doll, the one that tormented her in the movie. When it came to Stephen Collins, she went to bat for him when he was accused of sexual assault. "I really have nothing to say, nothing to hide. I don't know anything. Stephen's a good guy, in my opinion."</p><h2 id=jessica-biel-provided-some-scandal><strong>Jessica Biel Provided Some Scandal</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jessica Biel</a> played the oldest daughter in the Camden family and basically went through her teenage years on the show. She went through the show in the '90s when people just loved teens who were hot. As much as she loved the show that put her on the map, she started to disagree with where the show was taking her character. She wanted to leave the show and get out of her contract. She decided to pose in Gear at the time in very sexy poses that many thought were inappropriate for a 17-year-old girl. Stephen Collins compared them to child p--------y, which is very ironic, all things considered, and went on to say, “As a parent of a young daughter, this is very disturbing to me." Biel was hoping that the scandalous photos would get her fired from the show and end her contract. They didn’t fire her, however, and Biel later said she regretted the photos.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jeremy-london-was-kidnapped><strong>Jeremy London Was Kidnapped</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeremy London</a> came onto the show late during the seventh and eighth seasons. After the show ended, he continued to work consistently, though not in anything major. He’s been a busy guy and even has six projects in post-production. He’s always seemed to have problems with substance abuse and getting in trouble with the law. In 2010, he was involved in a weird kidnapping. He claimed that he was changing the tire on his car in California when a car full of guys stopped and dragged him into their vehicle. They drove around with him in the car for 12 hours and even force-fed him drugs at gunpoint. It was quite the bizarre situation that he found himself in. Not everyone believed the wild story, however, and his mother and brother publicly stated that he needed "psychological help and drug treatment as soon as possible." One of the kidnappers was eventually arrested, and he told a story about London wanting to drive around and party.</p><h2 id=mackenzie-rosman-s-leaked-photos><strong>Mackenzie Rosman’s Leaked Photos</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mackenzie Rosman</a> was the clever little Ruthie on the show. She was as young as 7 years old when the show started. She practically grew up on the show, which is probably why she went down the wrong track. When the show ended, Rosman’s behavior became erratic, especially after some provocative photos of the actress were leaked online. It showed a whole new side of the actress, and at the time, she was working the equestrian-jumping circuit, even winning a few of those competitions. She’s been in a few things over the years, although nothing major. She played in the show The Secret Life of the American Teenager and a few TV movies. She went on to pose in a sexy spread for Maxim in 2013, but she decided on posing in her panties once again because that time, it was on her terms.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ashlee-simpson-dates-the-pastor-s-son><strong>Ashlee Simpson Dates the Pastor’s Son</strong></h2><p>Believe it or not, but the singer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashlee Simpson</a> used to be on 7th Heaven. She was one of the recurring characters on the show who played the girlfriend to Simon Camden. She is, of course, the real-life sister of the mega-famous <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jessica Simpson</a>. Simpson had a very popular pop career in the 2000s, but that took a tumble in 2004 when she was caught lip-syncing on Saturday Night Live. She’s played in Melrose Place, CSI: NY, but embarrassingly enough, her last film was Space Dogs: Adventure to the Moon in 2014. She hasn’t done much since. She seems to be just laying low these days. She’s now married and has a couple of children. She may be dabbling in some of her sister's businesses, but she doesn’t seem to have any of her own projects on the go.</p><h2 id=matt-camden-cancer-scare><strong>Matt Camden Cancer Scare</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Barry Watson</a> played the oldest son, who eventually went to Med school. Since the show ended, he’s done quite well in Hollywood, working consistently through the years. He played alongside <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Katie Holmes</a> in the movie Teaching Mrs. Tingle and has played on many different TV shows such as What About Brian, Samantha Who, Gossip Girl, Hart of Dixie, Master of Sex, and most recently, Date My Dad. During 7th Heaven, there was a period of time from 2002-2003 that Watson left the show. Many people believed it was because he was busy working on Sorority Boys. It wasn’t, however, and Watson explained, "I was kind of certain that something was going on with my body." At the time, he found a lump in his neck that turned out to be IIB Hodgkin Lymphoma. He had to undergo chemotherapy and was much too sick to continue on 7th Heaven. He beat cancer, however, and returned to the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=stephen-collins-in-ruins><strong>Stephen Collins in Ruins</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephen Collins</a> played the pastor and father of the seven children on the show. He was an actor who was well loved in the industry. He went on to do just fine in Hollywood after 7th Heaven ended. He was never in anything major, but he was consistently acting since the show ended. He’s been seen in shows such as Law and Order: SVU, Devious Minds, Revolution, Private Practice, Falling Skies, and No Ordinary Family. He's bounced from one TV series to the next. That all ended in 2014 when he copped to sexually abusing three underage girls. It was officially the end of his career. He hasn’t been seen in anything since, which isn't surprising. He released a public apology regarding his devious deeds: “I deeply regret the mistakes I’ve made and any pain I have caused these three women. I admit to, apologize for, and take responsibility for what I did.”</p><h2 id=david-gallagher-went-back-to-school><strong>David Gallagher Went Back to School</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">David Gallagher</a> played the middle child on 7th Heaven, and after the show ended, he decided to go back to school at the University of Southern California. He left with a degree in film and television, which certainly suited his career in Hollywood. But he’s never really had a lot of big roles since 7th Heaven and has mainly stayed under the radar. He has a lot of guest roles in shows such as Vampire Diaries, Without a Trace, Criminal Minds,&nbsp;and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. He was also in a couple of movies like Super 8 and Look Who’s Talking Now. He seems content with where he is in the industry and has even voiced a few videos games like the voice of Riku in Kingdom of Hearts. He has a couple of projects in post-production and another video game voice over for Kingdom of Hearts III.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=stephen-collins-blindsides-wife><strong>Stephen Collins Blindsides Wife</strong></h2><p>The two met on the set of Tales of the Gold Monkey in 1982, and it seemed like love at first sight. Faye Grant was smitten and even went and told People Magazine that Collins must be "either gay or a complete jerk because he can't be as fabulous as he looks and be available!" They were together three years before they tied the knot in 1985. It looked like they were really going to make it after being together for 30 years, certainly one of the longest-running Hollywood marriages. Faye believed they were both happily married, so it came as quite a shock to her when Collins filed for divorce in 2012. "Stephen's filing for divorce is a surprise," she said. "I wish him the very best in whatever path he chooses to take. Twenty-seven years of marriage in Hollywood is the equivalent of 189 dog years." It may have had something to do with his affinity for young girls. He certainly could've used her support come 2014.</p><h2 id=geoff-stults-is-cursed><strong>Geoff Stults is Cursed</strong></h2><p>Poor Geoff Stults can’t seem to catch a break. It seems that every TV show that he tries to become involved in gets canceled. He’s even been considered to be a “show killer.” His costars have probably cringed when they found out that he’s been cast for a pilot because they know it’s inevitable that the show will be canceled. He certainly has been in a lot of TV shows over the years, but none of them have run for very long, some of them being canceled after only one or two seasons. These bombs include Ben & Kate, Happy Town, Enlisted, The Finder, Reunion, Happy Town, and October Road. That’s a lot of canceled shows. He was on the show Zoo in 2015, and thankfully, that one is still on the air, and he’s currently working on The Odd Couple, so let’s keep our fingers crossed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jessica-biel-became-the-mega-star><strong>Jessica Biel Became the Mega Star</strong></h2><p>Jessica Biel is the only actor on the show that hit mega-stardom. Despite the scandal with the photos in Gear Magazine, she seems to have made better decisions with her career. She’s done quite well in the industry and is still going strong. When she left 7th Heaven, she went on to star in a major film The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and went to be in some pretty badass movies such as A-Team, Hitchcock, Total Recall, The Illusionist, I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry,&nbsp;and New Year’s Eve, just to name a few. She married the love of her life, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin Timberlake</a>, and the two are going strong with a two-year-old in tow. She produced her own film in The Devil and the Deep Blue Sea. She's currently in the new HBO TV series The Sinner, which is seriously awesome, if you haven’t already checked it out.</p><h2 id=tyler-hoechlin-makes-it-big><strong>Tyler Hoechlin Makes It Big</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tyler Hoechlin</a> was on 7th Heaven for only five out of the eleven seasons, but he made quite the impression on the show as a hottie, and he’s even hotter these days. He’s done quite well for himself since the show ended and nabbed himself a great role in Hall Pass with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason Sudeikis</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Owen Wilson</a>. You don’t get much better than that. He also nabbed a major role on the TV show&nbsp;Teen Wolf, though that was short lived. He also was considered for the role of Edward Cullen in Twilight, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert Pattinson</a> got the part. Imagine what his career would've been like then? Currently, he’s on the TV series Supergirl and has some major roles coming up in post-production, including a part in the next Fifty Shades movie,&nbsp;Fifty Shades Freed. So all in all, Hoechlin has done well in his career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rachel-blanchard-loved-snakes-on-a-plane><strong>Rachel Blanchard Loved Snakes on a Plane</strong></h2><p>Rachel Blanchard was in the later seasons of 7th Heaven,&nbsp;and she played the part of police officer Roxanne Richardson. Since then, she's done decently in the industry. She's most known for her roles on Fargo and Flight of the&nbsp;<i>Conchords</i>. She also appeared on the British sitcom Peep Show and the movie Snakes on a Plane. These days, she hasn’t been doing much aside from her role as Emma on You Me Her, a TV series that she's been on for the past year. She's been working consistently in the industry but hasn’t fared as well as some of her other castmates. She's had some experience over the years that have shaped her because of the divorce between her parents. “The child gets two confusing messages when a parent tells him which is the right fork to use and then proceeds to use the wrong one. So does the child who listens to parents bicker and fuss, yet is told to be nice to his brothers and sisters.”</p><h2 id=haylie-duff-not-hillary-duff><strong>Haylie Duff, Not Hillary Duff</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Haylie Duff</a> is the less popular of the Duff sisters, but she's still been an actress who works consistently in Hollywood. We wonder, though, if she would've done just as well if she didn’t have a famous sister in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hilary Duff</a>. She was only in the tenth season of 7th Heaven, and she played the pregnant college student Sandy. She was in a few TV series after doing the voice for Summer on Napoleon Dynamite and then the series Blackout. Since then, though, it seems she's just been in one TV movie after the other. She certainly hasn't enjoyed the level of success that her sister has. She went on to do a guest appearance on Massholes as herself. These days, she’s been doing TV movies and low-budget films. She doesn’t seem to be going anywhere in the industry, so don’t expect her to be in any big-screen pictures.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Sources:&nbsp;zimbio.com;&nbsp;nickiswift.com</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWawoJGperW0xGaamqukYryneZatn2aglZbDprqMpaaoo6Niuaq3xGarqJyRrnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
