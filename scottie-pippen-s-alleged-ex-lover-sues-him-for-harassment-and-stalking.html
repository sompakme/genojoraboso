She also claimed the situation caused her “severe mental and emotional issues,” the loss of several employment opportunities, and even the loss of housing.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Valentine claimed that the 58-year-old used connections with local, state and federal employees to cancel and falsify police reports, in order to make her seem “mentally ill.” She is now seeking $250,000,000 million from Scottie,<a href=#> the Bulls,</a> and his family members.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Back in 2019, she&nbsp;also sued Pippen for $9,999, which was “the maximum allowed amount in small claims court” at the time over travel expenses to see him while he was married. She admitted that she didn’t know he was married to Karen McCollum at the time, and would visit Scottie on the road due to him promising to pay her back.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Additionally, she claimed that Pippen’s most recent <a href=#>ex-wife, Larsa</a>, “caused her suffering” at the time.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Pippen separated from McCollum in 1990 and <a href=#>wed Larsa</a> in 1997, before divorcing her in 2018.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-918914158.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6iwsMDTopxmqJmlvaa60maYpaSVnLKlecSxZKWnppq%2Fbr%2FUnqpmoJmieqmt0ZqqrKWVo8Fuv9Oao6Shnpx6cn6SbW9ub2FuhnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
