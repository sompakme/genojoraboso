He sells a vision in hopes that he can one day deliver what he's promising, but he doesn't know that," he told the outlet. "He's just really good at pretending he knows. That's very evident with the Tesla full-self-driving promise."</p><p>Jackson clarified that he’s been in touch with Elon before when they were considering working on a project together.</p><p>"The first time I messaged him on Twitter years ago, I had written a bot, a script that would automatically detect if there was a cryptocurrency scam in your Twitter mentions and would automatically report them to the platform,” he explained.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Dogecoin co-creator said that the more he worked with Elon, the more he realized the businessman knew little about what he was dealing with, which left a bad taste in his mouth.</p><p>"Elon reached out to me to get hold of that script and it became apparent very quickly that he didn't understand coding as well as he made out. He asked, 'How do I run this Python script?'" he said. Jackson added, "After I gave him the script, I wasn't a fan of him.”</p><p>Elon – known not to hold back from voicing his opinion on social media – has already reacted to Jackson’s comments on his character. "<a href=#>My kids write better code</a> when they were 12 than the nonsense script Jackson sent me," the father-of-eight wrote in a tweet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"If it's so great, he should share it with the world and make everyone's experience with Twitter better," the SpaceX founder continued. "If he does, you will see what I mean. Jackson Palmer is a tool."</p><p>Elon is currently in the process of <a href=#>buying Twitter for $44 billion</a> to make it more “politically neutral.”</p><p>"I want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans," he said in a statement announcing the buyout.</p><p>The billionaire has confirmed he’d <a href=#>reinstate former U.S. President Donald Trump’s Twitter account</a>, which was permanently suspended following the 2021 riots at Capitol Hill.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a href=#>Elon revealed the buyout has been halted</a> as he awaits further information about spam accounts statistics, though he says he’s still committed to going through with the deal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Mark Ruffalo & HBO Sued For Millions After Show Causes NYC Fire</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Crikey</a>, <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSxsLPEnKaipqNisLB5wqucmqyfp3qkrculqmadnKS7brnUrKJmmV2osKK5zJ6pZp6RoLJw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
