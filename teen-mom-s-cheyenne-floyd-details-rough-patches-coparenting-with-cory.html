“I think we definitely go through rough patches and moments [where] we have to all check each other in a respectful way,” Cheyenne, 30, exclusively told Us Weekly while promoting The Next Chapter. “We have a lot of check-ins where the four of us will get together and just lay everything out on the table, different topics, ideas."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

However, it wasn’t until later that year that Cory learned the baby was his child. The exes have since weathered many storms while raising their daughter.</p><p>“I think we definitely showcase our coparenting a lot more this season and how we all make this work and rely on each other,” Cheyenne told Us. “I feel, like, it’s cool to see, even when two [of us] are going through a hard time, how the other two show up for them. I just wanna see how it plays out.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter</a> season 2 premieres on MTV Wednesday, July 19, with back-to-back episodes starting at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatnZWjeq67zKxknKCVrrKvusRmnaWnqZl6pbHTmqClq12nvLazx2anmqyTnbK0ecKop5qqlaPBqrrGZq6irJhisLC%2B2Gg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
