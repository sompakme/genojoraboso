While the actress auditioned for various shows in all genres, she didn’t receive positive callbacks from places she expected.

After being selected for the second round of auditions for 2&nbsp;<i>Broke Girls</i>, the show’s co-creator Michael Patrick King suggested she go shopping and buy new clothes to create a stronger impression. The actress shopped at Nordstrom, bought expensive clothes, and didn’t even remove the tag on the Steve Madden heels in case she had to return them if the audition didn’t go right.</p><p>Beth Behrs was cast as the lead, Caroline Channing, a high-society girl who loses everything after her father is imprisoned for running a Ponzi scheme.
