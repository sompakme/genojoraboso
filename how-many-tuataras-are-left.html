There are reports that they are being stolen from zoos and offshore islands.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-can-i-find-tuatara></span>Where can I find tuatara?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>New Zealand Tuatara are a rare reptile found only in <b>New Zealand</b>. They are the last survivors of an order of reptiles that thrived in the age of the dinosaurs.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-tuatara-have-a-third-eye></span>Does tuatara have a third eye?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The tuatara <b>has a third eye on the top of its head called the parietal eye</b>. This eye has a retina, lens, cornea, and nerve endings, but it is not used for vision. The parietal eye is only visible in hatchlings, as it becomes covered in scales and pigments after four to six months.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-henry-the-tuatara-still-alive></span>Is Henry the tuatara still alive?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The Southland Museum cares for over 100 tuatara, all at different stages of development; from new born babies to teenagers, to our world famous Henry, who is <b>over 110 years old</b>. Incidentally, Henry holds the world record for living in captivity for over 46 years.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-much-is-a-tuatara-lizard></span>How much is a tuatara lizard?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Besides natural and introduced predators and habitat loss, tuatara face the threat of the black market reptile trade. In the illegal pet trade, a single <b>tuatara can fetch more than $40,000</b>. The tuatara is an ancient and unique species.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-a-tuatara-a-dinosaur></span>Is a tuatara a dinosaur?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>We now know that the tuatara is the only living member of Rhynchocephalia, a reptile group that was diverse and widespread between 240 million and 60 million years ago. … The tuatara is often referred to as a “living fossil” or even <b>a “living dinosaur”</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-a-tuataras-habitat></span>What is a Tuataras habitat?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Ecology and habitat<p>Tuatara inhabit <b>coastal forest and clearings</b>, using burrows for shelter (either sequestering bird burrows or digging their own), sharing habitat with sea birds such as shearwaters and petrels.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-tuatara-warm-blooded></span>Are tuatara warm blooded?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Tuatara have an interesting relationship with temperature. They are <b>ectotherms (”cold blooded”)</b> so their body temperature depends on the ambient temperature. They live in the forest, and are active at night, but spend sunny days basking at the entrance to their burrow.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-tuatara-lay-eggs></span>Do tuatara lay eggs?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The female can store sperm for 10 to 12 months before laying <b>1 to 19 white, soft-shelled eggs in nesting burrows</b>. The eggs incubate in the covered burrow for 12 to 15 months before hatching, possibly the longest incubation period of any reptile.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-bearded-dragons-older-than-dinosaurs></span>Are bearded dragons older than dinosaurs?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Bearded dragons are a type of lizard that branched out of the common reptilian trunk some 250 million years ago, much earlier than the branch that would lead to the dinosaurs and the birds. A phenomenon observed in a lizard, a bird and a mammal would thus most likely have existed in their common ancestor.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-does-the-word-tuatara-mean-in-english></span>What does the word Tuatara mean in English?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>tuatara in American English<p>(ˌtuːəˈtɑːrə) noun. <b>a large, primarily nocturnal, lizardlike reptile</b>, Sphenodon punctatum, of islands near the coast of New Zealand: the only surviving rhynchocephalian.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=which-is-the-largest-living-lizard></span>Which is the largest living lizard?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The Komodo dragon <b>The Komodo dragon</b> is the largest living lizard in the world. These wild dragons typically weigh about 154 pounds (70 kilograms), but the largest verified specimen reached a length of 10.3 feet (3.13 meters) and weighed 366 pounds (166 kilograms).<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-say-the-word-tuatara></span>How do you say the word tuatara?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-pronounce-sphenodontia></span>How do you pronounce Sphenodontia?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-pronounce-rhynchocephalia></span>How do you pronounce rhynchocephalia?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-pronounce-toreado></span>How do you pronounce Toreado?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-sphenodontia-order></span>What is Sphenodontia order?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The Sphenodontia is a diverse group of reptile. It includes only one living genus, the tuatara (Sphenodon). An alternative name for the order is <b>the Rhynchocephalia</b>.
